REVIEW  \n",
      "0  POWERFUL, LIGHTWEIGHT & EFFICIENT STICK VACUUM. The LG CordZero A925KSM Kompressor Stick Vacuum is similar to some other LG cordless vacuum models, and that is a very good thing. The LG A925KSM is an excellent cordless stick vacuum that performs very well and is very pleasant and easy to use.\\n \\n The LG CordZero A925KSM Kompressor arrives very well packed and includes the vacuum motor power head, an aluminum telescoping extension wand (20” collapsed, 29.5” extended), a universal power nozzle (for carpet and bare floors), a combination tool (with removable brush), a crevice tool, a free-standing / wall mountable, portable storage stand with integral battery charger, two lithium ion rechargeable batteries, a spare pre-filter for the motor and a small brush for cleaning the dirt collection canister and motor housing.\\n \\n Assembly of the charging stand is straightforward, and LG provides a quantity of printed product documentation. The stand has a weighted base, which I found to be very stable. The stand may also be wall mounted. The hardware for wall attachment is included. Notably, all of the included components and accessories are accommodated on the charging stand! \\n \\n The combination tool and crevice tool attachments can be used with or without the telescoping extension wand, easily accommodating cleaning out of reach areas, as well as close-up cleaning tasks such as upholstered furniture. The telescoping wand provides four latching positions. All of the attachments easily snap together and latch securely.\\n \\n Cordless stick vacuums are particularly attractive and desirable for their light weight, easy maneuverability and superior convenience. The LG CordZero A925 Kompressor excels in those attributes. \\n \\n The vacuum weighs only 5.95 lbs, with most of the weight concentrated in the motor unit and battery. The handle is large and comfortable. The thumb operated power on/off switch and motor speed control switches (+ / -) are conveniently located and easily operated. Switches only require momentary depression and do not need to be held continuously during operation as some stick vacuums require.\\n \\n The power vacuum nozzle is equipped with a ball-gimbal mount which affords outstanding maneuverability and directional control. The CordZero easily reaches under low furniture, and is easily maneuvered next to walls and furnishings for excellent edge cleaning.\\n \\n The power vacuum nozzle contains a motorized 9” brushroll which operates at all times for both carpeted and hard surface floors. A pair of small rollers facilitates movement on carpeting, but nevertheless, there are times when forward motion required additional physical effort. I found that a high angle of attack exacerbated that issue, and lowering the angle of the stick vacuum reduced the level of required effort. However, I also found that lowering the angle of attack often necessitates bending slightly to lower the handle/stick. This created an occasional annoyance. This issue does not result from the telescoping extension wand being too short. Rather, it is a product of the design of the leading edge of the of the power nozzle which can embed in carpet pile.\\n \\n LG provides a specification of 200 watts of suction power. If LG is actually describing an air watts rating, 200 watts is double the required 100 air watt standard for upright vacuums, and is only slightly below the 220 air watt standard for canister vacuums.\\n \\n I found the suction power to be more than adequate. The CordZero A925 provides three motor speeds (power levels) labeled as Normal, Power and Turbo. The default, Normal mode proved to be extremely effective on both hard and carpeted surfaces. The Power and Turbo motor speeds reduce battery run-time and increase noise level.\\n \\n LG claims 40 minutes of operation (per battery) in Normal mode, 20 minutes in Power mode and 6 minutes in Turbo mode when using the floor cleaning Universal Power Nozzle. When used with a non-powered tool, the claimed operating times are 60 minutes in Normal mode, 30 minutes in Power mode and 7 minutes in Turbo mode. When used with the power nozzle the claimed run times are 40 minutes in Normal mode, 20 minutes in Power mode and 6 minutes in Turbo mode. Using two fully charged batteries provides for doubling of the foregoing operating times. The power unit of the vacuum has an LED display with 3 incremental bars for battery capacity. After using the LG A925 several times, we believe that with the two included batteries, whole house cleaning is well within expectations.\\n \\n The lithium ion, batteries are 25.9 volt, 2.4 Ah / 62.16 Wh (2.3 Ah / 59.57 Wh minimum) capacity. Replacement batteries are expensive so they should be properly maintained. Battery charging is accommodated by charging one battery while attached to the vacuum motor unit as well as the second battery in the charging stand. Batteries are not charged simultaneously; they are charged sequentially. The charging stand first charges the battery which is attached to the vacuum, and upon completion, then charges the second battery in the stand. Each battery requires approximately 4 hours to fully charge (8 hours to charge both batteries).\\n \\n Completion of charging of each battery is annunciated by LED indicators (3 incremental LED bars on the vacuum handle for attached battery, and a single LED on the charging stand for second battery). Completed charging of the primary battery is also annunciated by a push-notification to the available LG Thin-Q smartphone app. The built-in LED panel also shows the progress of charging, the need for filter cleaning, detection of a clogged vacuum flow-path and indicates if Wi-Fi is active.\\n \\n I already had the Thin-Q app installed on my LG smartphone. Nevertheless, it required a few attempts to finally connect the vacuum with the app via wi-fi. The CordZero communicates only on 2.4GHz wi-fi.\\n \\n The Thin-Q app tracks usage of the CordZero by date and cleaning sessions, reporting total hours/minutes of use. It also displays the duration of use in each of the three power modes, and notifies the user when filters require cleaning. Additional data granularity might be useful, such as displaying the duration of individual cleaning sessions, rather than just the grand total of each day’s use. \\n \\n The Thin-Q app displays when the battery attached to the vacuum is being charged and when it is fully charged. It does not provide any additional battery status data such as the remaining capacity of the battery (% remaining), and when charging, the progress of the charge (% charged – time remaining to 100%). There is no information provided for the second battery.\\n \\n One improvement that I believe would be beneficial and appreciated would be the addition of an LED display (with pushbutton) on the LG batteries. Every tool battery pack that I own has such a display. It is very convenient to be able to simply press the button momentarily and for the approximate current remaining charge level of the battery to be instantly displayed on the LED lamps.\\n \\n Air filtration is comprised of multiple filter elements and is listed as being 5 stage HEPA filtration. The filters are removable and washable. A spare pre-filter is also included. \\n \\n The small dust collection bin can fill quickly. The CordZero A925 Kompressor employs a very unique lever operated “piston” to compress the dust and pet hair in the bin, thereby extending the intervals between emptying. A single press of the release latch quickly and neatly dumps the contents of the dust bin.\\n \\n I am hopeful that the CordZero A925 proves to be durable and reliable, but of course, only time will tell. The unit is comprised of a significant quantity of plastic components. The latch and hinge which secure the dust collection bin appear to potentially be fragile. Nevertheless, the vacuum appears to have a high quality build, with a solid feel and well made and nicely finished components. The LG CordZero A925 Kompressor is a high-quality stick vacuum!\\n \\n Overall, the LG CordZero A925 Kompressor stick vacuum is excellent. It is compact, lightweight, easily maneuverable, and efficient. It is powerful, yet not unpleasantly noisy. It is well-equipped with accessories which attach and detach with ease, and all of which have dedicated storage places on the included charging/storage stand. The two large capacity batteries provide approximately two hours of run-time with the non-powered tools or approximately 80 minutes of operating time when used with the power nozzle, which is more than adequate for thoroughly cleaning a large house. The vacuum cleaning power and efficiency are great.\\n \\n I believe that you will be just as thoroughly pleased and satisfied with the excellent CordZero A925 Kompressor stick vacuum as we are with ours!  \n",

The LG CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum is a great looking, relatively light vacuum cleaner which fits in nicely between our existing corded and robot vacuum cleaners.\\n \\n Unboxing and assembly seemed to take longer than I had anticipated, as some of the references in the quick-start and instructions referred to items that were not included in my set. It appears that there are three different flavors of this vacuum and although I am happy with mine, it had references to accessories, an accessory holder and mopping ability which this one does not have. Again, not a problem as I did not get the vacuum for mopping but it was a bit confusing at first to use the one-size-fits-all instructions.\\n \\n The manual advises charging the batteries before usage so I timed it and it was about an hour or so before the battery was fully charged. Once the vacuum charging mount is assembled, it provides a spot to charge the battery as well as dock the vacuum with its-on-board battery and both will charge in sequence. This means that once the primary battery runs out, you can just swap it out for the spare and then charge that one as you continue cleaning, doubling the effective running time. The vacuum itself will slide down the very top part of the mount and once settled there, it will charge the on-board battery as the other battery remains below, in its mount – very clever!\\n \\n The charging mount can be free-standing or attached to a wall with the included mounting hardware. You can even dispense with the stand’s foot if you are wall mounting and don’t need to free-stand the vacuum. I am using the freestanding mount for now but will likely mount it later down the line.\\n \\n The stand includes two accessory mount points which securely hold the two included tools (crevice and soft brush). It means that the accessories are not with you as you clean but they are at least in an obvious storage spot. Even some corded standing vacuums don’t have the tools on board so this is not a big deal but I occasionally see something I wish I had the tool for and then have to really want it, to stop what I am doing and head back to base for the tool.\\n \\n The vacuum can join your Wi-Fi network and then the LG ThinQ app will track things like battery life, cleaning history and other interesting but not necessary data. For me, it is mostly a novelty but I do like when the app notifies me that the batteries are fully charged again.\\n \\n Using the vacuum is quite liberating. After years of cleaning a 2600 square foot home with various corded vacuums, it was eye-opening to take the same route with a cordless vacuum.\\n \\n With the universal floor tool attached, I found I was moving around quicker than with the corded. As the vacuum is lighter and did not have as aggressive beater bar inside the floor tool, I was concerned it wasn’t as powerful as the corded. It certainly leaves less obvious marks on the carpet but still seemed to collect the same amount of carpet fiber, pet hair and other debris. The manual had warned that the universal floor tool might be loud on hard surfaces but I did not really notice and it did fine on our mix of carpet, vinyl and laminate floor.\\n \\n Being able to just keep going where I would previously have to retrace my steps, in order not to exceed the power cord length was great. In addition, the Kompressor technology helps to reduce stops and visits to empty the debris cannister in the garbage. The Kompressor really is just a push button slide that pushes hair, carpet fiber etc. down near the bottom of the cannister so you can continue vacuuming for longer. I found it did reduce stops but did not really push it to the limit, in case it reduced cleaning power. It also helped keep the cannister cleaner as debris wasn’t able to just gather at the top although it remains to be seen if that will continue to work or dust will build up near the top over time. That said, the manual said you could wash out the cannister so it may not be an issue if you keep up with maintenance.\\n \\n I was able to do about three quarters of our house, including stairs, with a single battery on normal power. Occasionally I would boost the power to get something embedded in the carpet but did not need the turbo function yet. The LG documentation shows that the battery life is drastically reduced if you run it in the higher modes for too long so I was careful.\\n \\n Swapping batteries was painless other than the vacuum abruptly stopping and needing to walk back to the charging station to swap them over. I then had plenty of power to return upstairs and finish the last two rooms.\\n \\n The app kept track of running time and battery status as I cleaned which was interesting but not especially useful. Perhaps over time it could be but the jury is still out for me on the app right now. At worst, it might be helpful when it comes time to replace some of the consumable parts like filters and batteries, which LG warns will wear out and need to be replaced at some point.\\n \\n In summary, I am very happy with the portability and power of this vacuum and it seemed to be on par with the bigger, heavier corded vacuum we own. It could be run as a stick vacuum or you could remove the stick part and use it to clean stairs or inside a car, with lots of power and even more portability to get in smaller spaces. The battery life is good enough to clean a fairly large house, especially as it comes with two batteries and one can always be on charge. The Kompressor tech is useful but not especially glamorous – still makes it better than most cannisters in terms of keeping them clean and how often they need emptying before they affect the cyclone effect. \\n \\n Great job LG!  \n",

This LG Cord Zero cordless stick vacuum with Kompressor technology comes with two batteries for extended run time and a clever dirt squisher.\\n \\n Kompressor technology is a clever built-in feature that compresses the dirt in the dust bin so it does not need to be emptied as often. Moving a lever is all it takes to squish the bin contents.\\n \\n Get up to 120 minutes of uninterrupted performance with a pair of included batteries. These batteries are said to be an upgraded lithium-ion design that can take repeated charges and discharges and come back for more.\\n \\n A portable charging stand is provided that holds the CordZero in place and does not require holes to be drilled into a wall, though wall mounting is an option.\\n \\n One-touch controls turn the vacuum on and off and adjust power levels up to Turbo mode with just a thumb. This should prove to be less strenuous on the hand.\\n \\n Telescope the wand for greater flexibility and to more conveniently store the unit away while taking up less space.\\n \\n Removable and washable filters extend the life of the vacuum. In addition, the cyclone system is removable and washable.\\n \\n A Smart Inverter Motor creates powerful suction and is backed by a 10-year limited warranty (the motor, not the batteries).\\n \\n The ThinQ app for iOS and Android allows users to check on the vacuum’s cleaning history and perform product diagnostics.\\n \\n Convertible from a stick to a hand vac, clean floors, furniture and vehicle interiors. Use the included Universal Power Nozzle when in hand vac mode.\\n \\n LG CordZero is recommended for homes with minimal carpeting or rugs. It is not recommended for use on any fiber floor covering with medium to deep pile, the same as for any vacuum with a spinning brush head.\\n \\n **WHAT’S IN THE BOX**\\n \\n • A925KSM CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum (Six pounds w/o accessories)\\n • Telescoping wand\\n • Universal Power Nozzle\\n • 2 Quick Release Batteries\\n • Portable Charging Station\\n • Crevice Tool\\n • Extra Pre-filter\\n • AC Power Adapter\\n \\n **THE SETUP**\\n \\n Manuals read, BOTH batteries charged (can take up to 240 minutes from fully discharged), it’s time to . . .\\n \\n **PUT IT TO THE TEST**\\n \\n A strong, not too loud, motor whir tells me this stick means business.There is plenty of suction even on the lowest power setting. Once it hits a low-pile rug, the power level should be increased for effectiveness, which it to be expected. \\n \\n The Kompressor lever is a novel gimmick and it works. As the bin fills, the contents tend to coalesce near the cyclonic ports. Using the Kompressor lever allows the dirt, dust and other debris to be compressed and directed to the bottom of the bin so it does not appear to require emptying so frequently. Who thought of this clever idea?\\n \\n Battery performance has been as expected, with both batteries providing enough power to clean everywhere. I like the ease-of-use when vacuuming inside our cars. \\n \\n Easy to empty, and the simple, washable filter is very effective. There are no consumables to deal with on a regular basis, though the filters will degrade over time. The batteries will eventually need to be replaced. Of equal importance is that the design does not create the need for unusual and unplanned deep cleaning of the CordZero itself.\\n \\n The brush head is easy to dismantle for removal of anything wrapped around the brush. A quarter-turn of the red screw on the bottom releases the cover for brush head access.\\n \\n There have been no clogs to remove.\\n \\n The Wi-Fi-enabled ThinQ App’s monitoring shows a detailed cleaning history and other stats but is, in my mind, a feature that is not so important or relevant to this reviewer.\\n \\n Everyone here is pretty impressed with this LG CordZero.\\n \\n **CONCLUSION**\\n \\n Easy to set up. Easy to use. Easy to like, even love. Very easy to recommend.\\n \\n **WARRANTY**\\n \\n Manufacturer’s one year warranty from the date of the original purchase, and 10 years on the Smart Inverter Motor  \n",

                                                                                                         Powerful compact stick vacuum!. Compact, bagless, super light and yet a powerful stick vacuum with tons of features. It came with an extra battery and an extra pre-filter along with a combination and crevice tool. The first thing I noticed on this superlight stick vacuum is the adjustable or telescopic wand and the Kompressor lever. The standalone charging base has an option to charge the second battery. The batteries themselves are compact and each battery is good for 60 min operation. \\n \\n Design:\\n Small form factor with a base station to charge the stick vacuum and the additional battery. The charging station or the base is heavy enough to hold the stick vacuum in place and I didn't have to worry about drilling holes in the walls to keep it secure. It does come with a wall mount option as well. I like the telescopic wand, lets me get under the furniture and everyone in my house including the kids can use it. The best part is the Kompressor lever that really compresses the dirt and keeps the filter free of debris. It will be a while before I have to empty the bin. It also helps clean the bin and not have to worry about getting your fingers in to pull the debris out- good thinking LG! The filters can be removed easily and washed in the sink. The best part is the roller or the brush head that can be easily removed by just twisting one end, and it slides right out. The roller has minimalist design, can twist, and turn easily to go around the corners and is powerful enough to pick up fine debris, and they are so easy to clean! The cyclone head slides right out as well and can be easily cleaned and washed in the sink. I started using this vacuum over other cordless ones that I have, just because of its design and the ease with which it can be cleaned. All the controls on the vacuum can be easily accessed with your thumb. I downloaded the LG ThinQ app to monitor its usage and diagnose issues right on the phone. I like the turbo mode option, gives me the ability to crank up the suction power to deep clean my rugs! I noticed the battery life reduce quite a bit (think about 20 mins) when I had the turbo mode on. The vacuum has three suction levels - normal, power, and turbo. The turbo mode definitely does get the job done when it comes to picking up fine dust. \\n \\n Function:\\n Coming to the suction power, I was impressed on how good it was it in picking up the fine dust from the rugs. The five-stage filtration system speaks for itself when you see the bin filled with fine dust! I live in a dry state and dust accumulation is a major problem and I can see using this vacuum every other day. It worked great on carpet and on hardwood floors and my only complaint was it has a small opening in the front, and it struggles to pick up large debris on the hardwood floors. \\n \\n Overall, I highly recommend this powerful vacuum just for the fact it has good suction power and ease of maintenance. It literally took me less than 10 minutes to clean the filter and the cyclone head, empty the dust bin, and clean the debris off the roller. It’s a little expensive but is comparable to the name brand ones on the suction power, but definitely beats the rest on ease of maintenance. I had it for over 2 weeks and used it every other day and happy with its suction power and battery life!  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Nice experience!. I have several vacuum cleaners, even though I don’t really enjoy vacuuming. I like the end result, but the actual process of vacuuming is a chore. I have never used a cordless stick vacuum like this LG one though. This vacuum is pretty quiet, which is saying a lot since I think most vacuum cleaners are loud as heck. And the air that blows out when I use it isn’t hot air. That is one of the big negatives about my standard stand up vac. I get so hot and sweaty whenever I use it, not just from pushing it around but the hot air that blows on me the whole time. This one is so effortless, it’s weird. I actually enjoy using it.\\n \\n This LG came with a wall-mount stand for the vac, but at this point, I’m not going to be installing that permanently on my wall somewhere. I have shared a picture of how to charge this vac if you chose to go unmounted like me. This vac came with a regular nozzle, combination tool, crevice tool and a cleaning brush. The cleaning brush is a nice touch because I really can get up and in the dirt cup with it to dislodge some of the hair that doesn’t want to fall out when I open the latch. It also came with an extra prefilter, which is nice. That has to be washed once in a while so it can be switched out and you can keep on vacuuming while one is hanging to dry. This vac comes with two batteries, so you can always have a backup. This vac comes with a nice maintenance guide which feels like a plastic sheet. It has a little suction cup so you can stick it somewhere to be able to reference as needed. There are several things you can do to keep this vac stick in good operating mode, so this is a good tool to remind you. I myself find it very satisfying to pop open the dirt cup and dump it into the trash can. \\n \\n I really like this stick vac to suck up the hair on my bathroom floor. With my regular push vac, it always sucks up the rugs that I have in there and it’s a pain. With this stick I just sweep with it and my rugs don’t get disturbed. There is a turbo power button for extra vacuum power. I use that when I can but definitely do just fine with regular mode on the tile floor. If I had just hard surface floors I could see just owning this vac stick. It’s so easy to use. The extension pipe that connects the nozzle to the vac unit can be used with the other tools, and it extends. If you are short or tall it can be adjusted to your liking. This is also very good for vacuuming up at the ceiling level, etc. It is very nice to be cordless. This is also nice for left handed users. Half of my family is left handed, but not me. I pay a lot of attention to how right handed everything is, and since this is cordless, it’s going to be easier to use with either hand.\\n \\n I connected this to my LG ThinQ app, it wasn’t too difficult. I already had the app because I have an LG smart TV, but for some reason, that isn’t on the app anymore and I couldn’t reconnect it. I’ll work on that later. Why connect a vacuum cleaner to a smart app? Well, it lets me know when my battery is finished charging. That’s actually very nice. It also tells me how many times someone has used the vac, and for how long. So if you want to keep tabs on that, here you go. Multiple people can share this info, they can all download the app.  \n"

      "text/plain": "0       POWERFUL, LIGHTWEIGHT & EFFICIENT STICK VACUUM. The LG CordZero A925KSM Kompressor Stick Vacuum is similar to some other LG cordless vacuum models, and that is a very good thing. The LG A925KSM is an excellent cordless stick vacuum that performs very well and is very pleasant and easy to use.\\n\\nThe LG CordZero A925KSM Kompressor arrives very well packed and includes the vacuum motor power head, an aluminum telescoping extension wand (20” collapsed, 29.5” extended), a universal power nozzle (for carpet and bare floors), a combination tool (with removable brush), a crevice tool, a free-standing / wall mountable, portable storage stand with integral battery charger, two lithium ion rechargeable batteries, a spare pre-filter for the motor and a small brush for cleaning the dirt collection canister and motor housing.\\n\\nAssembly of the charging stand is straightforward, and LG provides a quantity of printed product documentation. The stand has a weighted base, which I found to be very stable. The stand may also be wall mounted. The hardware for wall attachment is included. Notably, all of the included components and accessories are accommodated on the charging stand! \\n\\nThe combination tool and crevice tool attachments can be used with or without the telescoping extension wand, easily accommodating cleaning out of reach areas, as well as close-up cleaning tasks such as upholstered furniture. The telescoping wand provides four latching positions. All of the attachments easily snap together and latch securely.\\n\\nCordless stick vacuums are particularly attractive and desirable for their light weight, easy maneuverability and superior convenience. The LG CordZero A925 Kompressor excels in those attributes. \\n\\nThe vacuum weighs only 5.95 lbs, with most of the weight concentrated in the motor unit and battery. The handle is large and comfortable. The thumb operated power on/off switch and motor speed control switches (+ / -) are conveniently located and easily operated. Switches only require momentary depression and do not need to be held continuously during operation as some stick vacuums require.\\n\\nThe power vacuum nozzle is equipped with a ball-gimbal mount which affords outstanding maneuverability and directional control. The CordZero easily reaches under low furniture, and is easily maneuvered next to walls and furnishings for excellent edge cleaning.\\n\\nThe power vacuum nozzle contains a motorized 9” brushroll which operates at all times for both carpeted and hard surface floors. A pair of small rollers facilitates movement on carpeting, but nevertheless, there are times when forward motion required additional physical effort. I found that a high angle of attack exacerbated that issue, and lowering the angle of the stick vacuum reduced the level of required effort. However, I also found that lowering the angle of attack often necessitates bending slightly to lower the handle/stick. This created an occasional annoyance. This issue does not result from the telescoping extension wand being too short. Rather, it is a product of the design of the leading edge of the of the power nozzle which can embed in carpet pile.\\n\\nLG provides a specification of 200 watts of suction power. If LG is actually describing an air watts rating, 200 watts is double the required 100 air watt standard for upright vacuums, and is only slightly below the 220 air watt standard for canister vacuums.\\n\\nI found the suction power to be more than adequate. The CordZero A925 provides three motor speeds (power levels) labeled as Normal, Power and Turbo. The default, Normal mode proved to be extremely effective on both hard and carpeted surfaces. The Power and Turbo motor speeds reduce battery run-time and increase noise level.\\n\\nLG claims 40 minutes of operation (per battery) in Normal mode, 20 minutes in Power mode and 6 minutes in Turbo mode when using the floor cleaning Universal Power Nozzle. When used with a non-powered tool, the claimed operating times are 60 minutes in Normal mode, 30 minutes in Power mode and 7 minutes in Turbo mode. When used with the power nozzle the claimed run times are 40 minutes in Normal mode, 20 minutes in Power mode and 6 minutes in Turbo mode. Using two fully charged batteries provides for doubling of the foregoing operating times. The power unit of the vacuum has an LED display with 3 incremental bars for battery capacity. After using the LG A925 several times, we believe that with the two included batteries, whole house cleaning is well within expectations.\\n\\nThe lithium ion, batteries are 25.9 volt, 2.4 Ah / 62.16 Wh (2.3 Ah / 59.57 Wh minimum) capacity. Replacement batteries are expensive so they should be properly maintained. Battery charging is accommodated by charging one battery while attached to the vacuum motor unit as well as the second battery in the charging stand. Batteries are not charged simultaneously; they are charged sequentially. The charging stand first charges the battery which is attached to the vacuum, and upon completion, then charges the second battery in the stand. Each battery requires approximately 4 hours to fully charge (8 hours to charge both batteries).\\n\\nCompletion of charging of each battery is annunciated by LED indicators (3 incremental LED bars on the vacuum handle for attached battery, and a single LED on the charging stand for second battery). Completed charging of the primary battery is also annunciated by a push-notification to the available LG Thin-Q smartphone app. The built-in LED panel also shows the progress of charging, the need for filter cleaning, detection of a clogged vacuum flow-path and indicates if Wi-Fi is active.\\n\\nI already had the Thin-Q app installed on my LG smartphone. Nevertheless, it required a few attempts to finally connect the vacuum with the app via wi-fi. The CordZero communicates only on 2.4GHz wi-fi.\\n\\nThe Thin-Q app tracks usage of the CordZero by date and cleaning sessions, reporting total hours/minutes of use. It also displays the duration of use in each of the three power modes, and notifies the user when filters require cleaning. Additional data granularity might be useful, such as displaying the duration of individual cleaning sessions, rather than just the grand total of each day’s use. \\n\\nThe Thin-Q app displays when the battery attached to the vacuum is being charged and when it is fully charged. It does not provide any additional battery status data such as the remaining capacity of the battery (% remaining), and when charging, the progress of the charge (% charged – time remaining to 100%). There is no information provided for the second battery.\\n\\nOne improvement that I believe would be beneficial and appreciated would be the addition of an LED display (with pushbutton) on the LG batteries. Every tool battery pack that I own has such a display. It is very convenient to be able to simply press the button momentarily and for the approximate current remaining charge level of the battery to be instantly displayed on the LED lamps.\\n\\nAir filtration is comprised of multiple filter elements and is listed as being 5 stage HEPA filtration. The filters are removable and washable. A spare pre-filter is also included. \\n\\nThe small dust collection bin can fill quickly. The CordZero A925 Kompressor employs a very unique lever operated “piston” to compress the dust and pet hair in the bin, thereby extending the intervals between emptying. A single press of the release latch quickly and neatly dumps the contents of the dust bin.\\n\\nI am hopeful that the CordZero A925 proves to be durable and reliable, but of course, only time will tell. The unit is comprised of a significant quantity of plastic components. The latch and hinge which secure the dust collection bin appear to potentially be fragile. Nevertheless, the vacuum appears to have a high quality build, with a solid feel and well made and nicely finished components. The LG CordZero A925 Kompressor is a high-quality stick vacuum!\\n\\nOverall, the LG CordZero A925 Kompressor stick vacuum is excellent. It is compact, lightweight, easily maneuverable, and efficient. It is powerful, yet not unpleasantly noisy. It is well-equipped with accessories which attach and detach with ease, and all of which have dedicated storage places on the included charging/storage stand. The two large capacity batteries provide approximately two hours of run-time with the non-powered tools or approximately 80 minutes of operating time when used with the power nozzle, which is more than adequate for thoroughly cleaning a large house. The vacuum cleaning power and efficiency are great.\\n\\nI believe that you will be just as thoroughly pleased and satisfied with the excellent CordZero A925 Kompressor stick vacuum as we are with ours!\n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Highly portable, yet powerful stick vacuum. The LG CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum is a great looking, relatively light vacuum cleaner which fits in nicely between our existing corded and robot vacuum cleaners.\\n\\nUnboxing and assembly seemed to take longer than I had anticipated, as some of the references in the quick-start and instructions referred to items that were not included in my set. It appears that there are three different flavors of this vacuum and although I am happy with mine, it had references to accessories, an accessory holder and mopping ability which this one does not have. Again, not a problem as I did not get the vacuum for mopping but it was a bit confusing at first to use the one-size-fits-all instructions.\\n\\nThe manual advises charging the batteries before usage so I timed it and it was about an hour or so before the battery was fully charged. Once the vacuum charging mount is assembled, it provides a spot to charge the battery as well as dock the vacuum with its-on-board battery and both will charge in sequence. This means that once the primary battery runs out, you can just swap it out for the spare and then charge that one as you continue cleaning, doubling the effective running time. The vacuum itself will slide down the very top part of the mount and once settled there, it will charge the on-board battery as the other battery remains below, in its mount – very clever!\\n\\nThe charging mount can be free-standing or attached to a wall with the included mounting hardware. You can even dispense with the stand’s foot if you are wall mounting and don’t need to free-stand the vacuum. I am using the freestanding mount for now but will likely mount it later down the line.\\n\\nThe stand includes two accessory mount points which securely hold the two included tools (crevice and soft brush). It means that the accessories are not with you as you clean but they are at least in an obvious storage spot. Even some corded standing vacuums don’t have the tools on board so this is not a big deal but I occasionally see something I wish I had the tool for and then have to really want it, to stop what I am doing and head back to base for the tool.\\n\\nThe vacuum can join your Wi-Fi network and then the LG ThinQ app will track things like battery life, cleaning history and other interesting but not necessary data. For me, it is mostly a novelty but I do like when the app notifies me that the batteries are fully charged again.\\n\\nUsing the vacuum is quite liberating. After years of cleaning a 2600 square foot home with various corded vacuums, it was eye-opening to take the same route with a cordless vacuum.\\n\\nWith the universal floor tool attached, I found I was moving around quicker than with the corded. As the vacuum is lighter and did not have as aggressive beater bar inside the floor tool, I was concerned it wasn’t as powerful as the corded. It certainly leaves less obvious marks on the carpet but still seemed to collect the same amount of carpet fiber, pet hair and other debris. The manual had warned that the universal floor tool might be loud on hard surfaces but I did not really notice and it did fine on our mix of carpet, vinyl and laminate floor.\\n\\nBeing able to just keep going where I would previously have to retrace my steps, in order not to exceed the power cord length was great. In addition, the Kompressor technology helps to reduce stops and visits to empty the debris cannister in the garbage. The Kompressor really is just a push button slide that pushes hair, carpet fiber etc. down near the bottom of the cannister so you can continue vacuuming for longer. I found it did reduce stops but did not really push it to the limit, in case it reduced cleaning power. It also helped keep the cannister cleaner as debris wasn’t able to just gather at the top although it remains to be seen if that will continue to work or dust will build up near the top over time. That said, the manual said you could wash out the cannister so it may not be an issue if you keep up with maintenance.\\n\\nI was able to do about three quarters of our house, including stairs, with a single battery on normal power. Occasionally I would boost the power to get something embedded in the carpet but did not need the turbo function yet. The LG documentation shows that the battery life is drastically reduced if you run it in the higher modes for too long so I was careful.\\n\\nSwapping batteries was painless other than the vacuum abruptly stopping and needing to walk back to the charging station to swap them over. I then had plenty of power to return upstairs and finish the last two rooms.\\n\\nThe app kept track of running time and battery status as I cleaned which was interesting but not especially useful. Perhaps over time it could be but the jury is still out for me on the app right now. At worst, it might be helpful when it comes time to replace some of the consumable parts like filters and batteries, which LG warns will wear out and need to be replaced at some point.\\n\\nIn summary, I am very happy with the portability and power of this vacuum and it seemed to be on par with the bigger, heavier corded vacuum we own. It could be run as a stick vacuum or you could remove the stick part and use it to clean stairs or inside a car, with lots of power and even more portability to get in smaller spaces. The battery life is good enough to clean a fairly large house, especially as it comes with two batteries and one can always be on charge. The Kompressor tech is useful but not especially glamorous – still makes it better than most cannisters in terms of keeping them clean and how often they need emptying before they affect the cyclone effect. \\n\\nGreat job LG!\n2

                    LG CordZero A925KSM Cordless Stick Is A STANDOUT. This LG Cord Zero cordless stick vacuum with Kompressor technology comes with two batteries for extended run time and a clever dirt squisher.\\n\\nKompressor technology is a clever built-in feature that compresses the dirt in the dust bin so it does not need to be emptied as often. Moving a lever is all it takes to squish the bin contents.\\n\\nGet up to 120 minutes of uninterrupted performance with a pair of included batteries. These batteries are said to be an upgraded lithium-ion design that can take repeated charges and discharges and come back for more.\\n\\nA portable charging stand is provided that holds the CordZero in place and does not require holes to be drilled into a wall, though wall mounting is an option.\\n\\nOne-touch controls turn the vacuum on and off and adjust power levels up to Turbo mode with just a thumb. This should prove to be less strenuous on the hand.\\n\\nTelescope the wand for greater flexibility and to more conveniently store the unit away while taking up less space.\\n\\nRemovable and washable filters extend the life of the vacuum. In addition, the cyclone system is removable and washable.\\n\\nA Smart Inverter Motor creates powerful suction and is backed by a 10-year limited warranty (the motor, not the batteries).\\n\\nThe ThinQ app for iOS and Android allows users to check on the vacuum’s cleaning history and perform product diagnostics.\\n\\nConvertible from a stick to a hand vac, clean floors, furniture and vehicle interiors. Use the included Universal Power Nozzle when in hand vac mode.\\n\\nLG CordZero is recommended for homes with minimal carpeting or rugs. It is not recommended for use on any fiber floor covering with medium to deep pile, the same as for any vacuum with a spinning brush head.\\n\\n**WHAT’S IN THE BOX**\\n\\n• A925KSM CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum (Six pounds w/o accessories)\\n• Telescoping wand\\n• Universal Power Nozzle\\n• 2 Quick Release Batteries\\n• Portable Charging Station\\n• Crevice Tool\\n• Extra Pre-filter\\n• AC Power Adapter\\n\\n**THE SETUP**\\n\\nManuals read, BOTH batteries charged (can take up to 240 minutes from fully discharged), it’s time to . . .\\n\\n**PUT IT TO THE TEST**\\n\\nA strong, not too loud, motor whir tells me this stick means business.There is plenty of suction even on the lowest power setting. Once it hits a low-pile rug, the power level should be increased for effectiveness, which it to be expected. \\n\\nThe Kompressor lever is a novel gimmick and it works. As the bin fills, the contents tend to coalesce near the cyclonic ports. Using the Kompressor lever allows the dirt, dust and other debris to be compressed and directed to the bottom of the bin so it does not appear to require emptying so frequently. Who thought of this clever idea?\\n\\nBattery performance has been as expected, with both batteries providing enough power to clean everywhere. I like the ease-of-use when vacuuming inside our cars. \\n\\nEasy to empty, and the simple, washable filter is very effective. There are no consumables to deal with on a regular basis, though the filters will degrade over time. The batteries will eventually need to be replaced. Of equal importance is that the design does not create the need for unusual and unplanned deep cleaning of the CordZero itself.\\n\\nThe brush head is easy to dismantle for removal of anything wrapped around the brush. A quarter-turn of the red screw on the bottom releases the cover for brush head access.\\n\\nThere have been no clogs to remove.\\n\\nThe Wi-Fi-enabled ThinQ App’s monitoring shows a detailed cleaning history and other stats but is, in my mind, a feature that is not so important or relevant to this reviewer.\\n\\nEveryone here is pretty impressed with this LG CordZero.\\n\\n**CONCLUSION**\\n\\nEasy to set up. Easy to use. Easy to like, even love. Very easy to recommend.\\n\\n**WARRANTY**\\n\\nManufacturer’s one year warranty from the date of the original purchase, and 10 years on the Smart Inverter Motor\n3

                              Powerful compact stick vacuum!. Compact, bagless, super light and yet a powerful stick vacuum with tons of features. It came with an extra battery and an extra pre-filter along with a combination and crevice tool. The first thing I noticed on this superlight stick vacuum is the adjustable or telescopic wand and the Kompressor lever. The standalone charging base has an option to charge the second battery. The batteries themselves are compact and each battery is good for 60 min operation. \\n\\nDesign:  Small form factor with a base station to charge the stick vacuum and the additional battery. The charging station or the base is heavy enough to hold the stick vacuum in place and I didn't have to worry about drilling holes in the walls to keep it secure. It does come with a wall mount option as well. I like the telescopic wand, lets me get under the furniture and everyone in my house including the kids can use it. The best part is the Kompressor lever that really compresses the dirt and keeps the filter free of debris. It will be a while before I have to empty the bin. It also helps clean the bin and not have to worry about getting your fingers in to pull the debris out- good thinking LG! The filters can be removed easily and washed in the sink. The best part is the roller or the brush head that can be easily removed by just twisting one end, and it slides right out. The roller has minimalist design, can twist, and turn easily to go around the corners and is powerful enough to pick up fine debris, and they are so easy to clean! The cyclone head slides right out as well and can be easily cleaned and washed in the sink. I started using this vacuum over other cordless ones that I have, just because of its design and the ease with which it can be cleaned. All the controls on the vacuum can be easily accessed with your thumb. I downloaded the LG ThinQ app to monitor its usage and diagnose issues right on the phone. I like the turbo mode option, gives me the ability to crank up the suction power to deep clean my rugs! I noticed the battery life reduce quite a bit (think about 20 mins) when I had the turbo mode on. The vacuum has three suction levels - normal, power, and turbo. The turbo mode definitely does get the job done when it comes to picking up fine dust. \\n\\nFunction:  Coming to the suction power, I was impressed on how good it was it in picking up the fine dust from the rugs. The five-stage filtration system speaks for itself when you see the bin filled with fine dust! I live in a dry state and dust accumulation is a major problem and I can see using this vacuum every other day. It worked great on carpet and on hardwood floors and my only complaint was it has a small opening in the front, and it struggles to pick up large debris on the hardwood floors. \\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend this powerful vacuum just for the fact it has good suction power and ease of maintenance. It literally took me less than 10 minutes to clean the filter and the cyclone head, empty the dust bin, and clean the debris off the roller. It’s a little expensive but is comparable to the name brand ones on the suction power, but definitely beats the rest on ease of maintenance. I had it for over 2 weeks and used it every other day and happy with its suction power and battery life!\n4

                                                                                                                                                                                                            Nice experience!. I have several vacuum cleaners, even though I don’t really enjoy vacuuming. I like the end result, but the actual process of vacuuming is a chore. I have never used a cordless stick vacuum like this LG one though. This vacuum is pretty quiet, which is saying a lot since I think most vacuum cleaners are loud as heck. And the air that blows out when I use it isn’t hot air. That is one of the big negatives about my standard stand up vac. I get so hot and sweaty whenever I use it, not just from pushing it around but the hot air that blows on me the whole time. This one is so effortless, it’s weird. I actually enjoy using it.\\n\\nThis LG came with a wall-mount stand for the vac, but at this point, I’m not going to be installing that permanently on my wall somewhere. I have shared a picture of how to charge this vac if you chose to go unmounted like me. This vac came with a regular nozzle, combination tool, crevice tool and a cleaning brush. The cleaning brush is a nice touch because I really can get up and in the dirt cup with it to dislodge some of the hair that doesn’t want to fall out when I open the latch. It also came with an extra prefilter, which is nice. That has to be washed once in a while so it can be switched out and you can keep on vacuuming while one is hanging to dry. This vac comes with two batteries, so you can always have a backup. This vac comes with a nice maintenance guide which feels like a plastic sheet. It has a little suction cup so you can stick it somewhere to be able to reference as needed. There are several things you can do to keep this vac stick in good operating mode, so this is a good tool to remind you. I myself find it very satisfying to pop open the dirt cup and dump it into the trash can. \\n\\nI really like this stick vac to suck up the hair on my bathroom floor. With my regular push vac, it always sucks up the rugs that I have in there and it’s a pain. With this stick I just sweep with it and my rugs don’t get disturbed. There is a turbo power button for extra vacuum power. I use that when I can but definitely do just fine with regular mode on the tile floor. If I had just hard surface floors I could see just owning this vac stick. It’s so easy to use. The extension pipe that connects the nozzle to the vac unit can be used with the other tools, and it extends. If you are short or tall it can be adjusted to your liking. This is also very good for vacuuming up at the ceiling level, etc. It is very nice to be cordless. This is also nice for left handed users. Half of my family is left handed, but not me. I pay a lot of attention to how right handed everything is, and since this is cordless, it’s going to be easier to use with either hand.\\n\\nI connected this to my LG ThinQ app, it wasn’t too difficult. I already had the app because I have an LG smart TV, but for some reason, that isn’t on the app anymore and I couldn’t reconnect it. I’ll work on that later. Why connect a vacuum cleaner to a smart app? Well, it lets me know when my battery is finished charging. That’s actually very nice. It also tells me how many times someone has used the vac, and for how long. So if you want to keep tabs on that, here you go. Multiple people can share this info, they can all download the app.\n

vacuum!. This is my first wireless vacuum after a life of corded uprights. I can't believe how great it is - if I see dirt or a ball of dust - just grab the vacuum off the rechargeable stand, vacuum it up and return it. No more unwinding the cord, vacuuming, then winding it back up. Also - if you are used to a corded vacuum like me - this one is so light! Vacuuming stairs has never been easier (or safer in my opinion). It has a spare battery if you have a lot of cleaning to do. I have not needed it yet. The suction on it is great and it is very easy to steer around corners. A great vacuum indeed!\n1225

I have to say I was blown away by this product. I didn't expect to love it so much, but LG went above and beyond to make this easy for the buyer, and effortless for cleaning. This is likely the best purchase I've made this year.\n1226

Easy to use and great on all surfaces.\\n\\nLight weight, doesn’t require lots of space, this is the all time best vacuum I have ever had!!\n1227

It’s quiet and powerful and in a household with 2 kids and a dog, we need both. The adjustable length is huge, too, because it’s comfortable for everyone in the house to use. And can we talk about the fact that the vacuum empties itself when it’s on the charging dock? Wow. Game changer.\nName: REVIEW, Length: 1229, dtype: object"

      "text/plain": "['POWERFUL, LIGHTWEIGHT & EFFICIENT STICK VACUUM. The LG CordZero A925KSM Kompressor Stick Vacuum is similar to some other LG cordless vacuum models, and that is a very good thing. The LG A925KSM is an excellent cordless stick vacuum that performs very well and is very pleasant and easy to use.',\n 'The LG CordZero A925KSM Kompressor arrives very well packed and includes the vacuum motor power head, an aluminum telescoping extension wand (20” collapsed, 29.5” extended), a universal power nozzle (for carpet and bare floors), a combination tool (with removable brush), a crevice tool, a free-standing / wall mountable, portable storage stand with integral battery charger, two lithium ion rechargeable batteries, a spare pre-filter for the motor and a small brush for cleaning the dirt collection canister and motor housing.',\n 'Assembly of the charging stand is straightforward, and LG provides a quantity of printed product documentation. The stand has a weighted base, which I found to be very stable. The stand may also be wall mounted. The hardware for wall attachment is included. Notably, all of the included components and accessories are accommodated on the charging stand! ',\n 'The combination tool and crevice tool attachments can be used with or without the telescoping extension wand, easily accommodating cleaning out of reach areas, as well as close-up cleaning tasks such as upholstered furniture. The telescoping wand provides four latching positions. All of the attachments easily snap together and latch securely.',\n 'Cordless stick vacuums are particularly attractive and desirable for their light weight, easy maneuverability and superior convenience. The LG CordZero A925 Kompressor excels in those attributes. ',\n 'The vacuum weighs only 5.95 lbs, with most of the weight concentrated in the motor unit and battery. The handle is large and comfortable. The thumb operated power on/off switch and motor speed control switches (+ / -) are conveniently located and easily operated. Switches only require momentary depression and do not need to be held continuously during operation as some stick vacuums require.',\n 'The power vacuum nozzle is equipped with a ball-gimbal mount which affords outstanding maneuverability and directional control. The CordZero easily reaches under low furniture, and is easily maneuvered next to walls and furnishings for excellent edge cleaning.',\n 'The power vacuum nozzle contains a motorized 9” brushroll which operates at all times for both carpeted and hard surface floors. A pair of small rollers facilitates movement on carpeting, but nevertheless, there are times when forward motion required additional physical effort. I found that a high angle of attack exacerbated that issue, and lowering the angle of the stick vacuum reduced the level of required effort. However, I also found that lowering the angle of attack often necessitates bending slightly to lower the handle/stick. This created an occasional annoyance. This issue does not result from the telescoping extension wand being too short. Rather, it is a product of the design of the leading edge of the of the power nozzle which can embed in carpet pile.',\n 'LG provides a specification of 200 watts of suction power. If LG is actually describing an air watts rating, 200 watts is double the required 100 air watt standard for upright vacuums, and is only slightly below the 220 air watt standard for canister vacuums.',\n 'I found the suction power to be more than adequate. The CordZero A925 provides three motor speeds (power levels) labeled as Normal, Power and Turbo. The default, Normal mode proved to be extremely effective on both hard and carpeted surfaces. The Power and Turbo motor speeds reduce battery run-time and increase noise level.',\n 'LG claims 40 minutes of operation (per battery) in Normal mode, 20 minutes in Power mode and 6 minutes in Turbo mode when using the floor cleaning Universal Power Nozzle. When used with a non-powered tool, the claimed operating times are 60 minutes in Normal mode, 30 minutes in Power mode and 7 minutes in Turbo mode. When used with the power nozzle the claimed run times are 40 minutes in Normal mode, 20 minutes in Power mode and 6 minutes in Turbo mode. Using two fully charged batteries provides for doubling of the foregoing operating times. The power unit of the vacuum has an LED display with 3 incremental bars for battery capacity. After using the LG A925 several times, we believe that with the two included batteries, whole house cleaning is well within expectations.',\n 'The lithium ion, batteries are 25.9 volt, 2.4 Ah / 62.16 Wh (2.3 Ah / 59.57 Wh minimum) capacity. Replacement batteries are expensive so they should be properly maintained. Battery charging is accommodated by charging one battery while attached to the vacuum motor unit as well as the second battery in the charging stand. Batteries are not charged simultaneously; they are charged sequentially. The charging stand first charges the battery which is attached to the vacuum, and upon completion, then charges the second battery in the stand. Each battery requires approximately 4 hours to fully charge (8 hours to charge both batteries).',\n 'Completion of charging of each battery is annunciated by LED indicators (3 incremental LED bars on the vacuum handle for attached battery, and a single LED on the charging stand for second battery). Completed charging of the primary battery is also annunciated by a push-notification to the available LG Thin-Q smartphone app. The built-in LED panel also shows the progress of charging, the need for filter cleaning, detection of a clogged vacuum flow-path and indicates if Wi-Fi is active.',\n 'I already had the Thin-Q app installed on my LG smartphone. Nevertheless, it required a few attempts to finally connect the vacuum with the app via wi-fi. The CordZero communicates only on 2.4GHz wi-fi.',\n 'The Thin-Q app tracks usage of the CordZero by date and cleaning sessions, reporting total hours/minutes of use. It also displays the duration of use in each of the three power modes, and notifies the user when filters require cleaning. Additional data granularity might be useful, such as displaying the duration of individual cleaning sessions, rather than just the grand total of each day’s use. ',\n 'The Thin-Q app displays when the battery attached to the vacuum is being charged and when it is fully charged. It does not provide any additional battery status data such as the remaining capacity of the battery (% remaining), and when charging, the progress of the charge (% charged – time remaining to 100%). There is no information provided for the second battery.',\n 'One improvement that I believe would be beneficial and appreciated would be the addition of an LED display (with pushbutton) on the LG batteries. Every tool battery pack that I own has such a display. It is very convenient to be able to simply press the button momentarily and for the approximate current remaining charge level of the battery to be instantly displayed on the LED lamps.',\n 'Air filtration is comprised of multiple filter elements and is listed as being 5 stage HEPA filtration. The filters are removable and washable. A spare pre-filter is also included. ',\n 'The small dust collection bin can fill quickly. The CordZero A925 Kompressor employs a very unique lever operated “piston” to compress the dust and pet hair in the bin, thereby extending the intervals between emptying. A single press of the release latch quickly and neatly dumps the contents of the dust bin.',\n 'I am hopeful that the CordZero A925 proves to be durable and reliable, but of course, only time will tell. The unit is comprised of a significant quantity of plastic components. The latch and hinge which secure the dust collection bin appear to potentially be fragile. Nevertheless, the vacuum appears to have a high quality build, with a solid feel and well made and nicely finished components. The LG CordZero A925 Kompressor is a high-quality stick vacuum!',\n 'Overall, the LG CordZero A925 Kompressor stick vacuum is excellent. It is compact, lightweight, easily maneuverable, and efficient. It is powerful, yet not unpleasantly noisy. It is well-equipped with accessories which attach and detach with ease, and all of which have dedicated storage places on the included charging/storage stand. The two large capacity batteries provide approximately two hours of run-time with the non-powered tools or approximately 80 minutes of operating time when used with the power nozzle, which is more than adequate for thoroughly cleaning a large house. The vacuum cleaning power and efficiency are great.',\n 'I believe that you will be just as thoroughly pleased and satisfied with the excellent CordZero A925 Kompressor stick vacuum as we are with ours!']"

                                       PARAGRAPHS  \n0  [POWERFUL, LIGHTWEIGHT & EFFICIENT STICK VACUUM. The LG CordZero A925KSM Kompressor Stick Vacuum is similar to some other LG cordless vacuum models, and that is a very good thing. The LG A925KSM is an excellent cordless stick vacuum that performs very well and is very pleasant and easy to use., The LG CordZero A925KSM Kompressor arrives very well packed and includes the vacuum motor power head, an aluminum telescoping extension wand (20” collapsed, 29.5” extended), a universal power nozzle (for carpet and bare floors), a combination tool (with removable brush), a crevice tool, a free-standing / wall mountable, portable storage stand with integral battery charger, two lithium ion rechargeable batteries, a spare pre-filter for the motor and a small brush for cleaning the dirt collection canister and motor housing., Assembly of the charging stand is straightforward, and LG provides a quantity of printed product documentation. The stand has a weighted base, which I found to be very stable. The stand may also be wall mounted. The hardware for wall attachment is included. Notably, all of the included components and accessories are accommodated on the charging stand! , The combination tool and crevice tool attachments can be used with or without the telescoping extension wand, easily accommodating cleaning out of reach areas, as well as close-up cleaning tasks such as upholstered furniture. The telescoping wand provides four latching positions. All of the attachments easily snap together and latch securely., Cordless stick vacuums are particularly attractive and desirable for their light weight, easy maneuverability and superior convenience. The LG CordZero A925 Kompressor excels in those attributes. , The vacuum weighs only 5.95 lbs, with most of the weight concentrated in the motor unit and battery. The handle is large and comfortable. The thumb operated power on/off switch and motor speed control switches (+ / -) are conveniently located and easily operated. Switches only require momentary depression and do not need to be held continuously during operation as some stick vacuums require., The power vacuum nozzle is equipped with a ball-gimbal mount which affords outstanding maneuverability and directional control. The CordZero easily reaches under low furniture, and is easily maneuvered next to walls and furnishings for excellent edge cleaning., The power vacuum nozzle contains a motorized 9” brushroll which operates at all times for both carpeted and hard surface floors. A pair of small rollers facilitates movement on carpeting, but nevertheless, there are times when forward motion required additional physical effort. I found that a high angle of attack exacerbated that issue, and lowering the angle of the stick vacuum reduced the level of required effort. However, I also found that lowering the angle of attack often necessitates bending slightly to lower the handle/stick. This created an occasional annoyance. This issue does not result from the telescoping extension wand being too short. Rather, it is a product of the design of the leading edge of the of the power nozzle which can embed in carpet pile., LG provides a specification of 200 watts of suction power. If LG is actually describing an air watts rating, 200 watts is double the required 100 air watt standard for upright vacuums, and is only slightly below the 220 air watt standard for canister vacuums., I found the suction power to be more than adequate. The CordZero A925 provides three motor speeds (power levels) labeled as Normal, Power and Turbo. The default, Normal mode proved to be extremely effective on both hard and carpeted surfaces. The Power and Turbo motor speeds reduce battery run-time and increase noise level., LG claims 40 minutes of operation (per battery) in Normal mode, 20 minutes in Power mode and 6 minutes in Turbo mode when using the floor cleaning Universal Power Nozzle. When used with a non-powered tool, the claimed operating times are 60 minutes in Normal mode, 30 minutes in Power mode and 7 minutes in Turbo mode. When used with the power nozzle the claimed run times are 40 minutes in Normal mode, 20 minutes in Power mode and 6 minutes in Turbo mode. Using two fully charged batteries provides for doubling of the foregoing operating times. The power unit of the vacuum has an LED display with 3 incremental bars for battery capacity. After using the LG A925 several times, we believe that with the two included batteries, whole house cleaning is well within expectations., The lithium ion, batteries are 25.9 volt, 2.4 Ah / 62.16 Wh (2.3 Ah / 59.57 Wh minimum) capacity. Replacement batteries are expensive so they should be properly maintained. Battery charging is accommodated by charging one battery while attached to the vacuum motor unit as well as the second battery in the charging stand. Batteries are not charged simultaneously; they are charged sequentially. The charging stand first charges the battery which is attached to the vacuum, and upon completion, then charges the second battery in the stand. Each battery requires approximately 4 hours to fully charge (8 hours to charge both batteries)., Completion of charging of each battery is annunciated by LED indicators (3 incremental LED bars on the vacuum handle for attached battery, and a single LED on the charging stand for second battery). Completed charging of the primary battery is also annunciated by a push-notification to the available LG Thin-Q smartphone app. The built-in LED panel also shows the progress of charging, the need for filter cleaning, detection of a clogged vacuum flow-path and indicates if Wi-Fi is active., I already had the Thin-Q app installed on my LG smartphone. Nevertheless, it required a few attempts to finally connect the vacuum with the app via wi-fi. The CordZero communicates only on 2.4GHz wi-fi., The Thin-Q app tracks usage of the CordZero by date and cleaning sessions, reporting total hours/minutes of use. It also displays the duration of use in each of the three power modes, and notifies the user when filters require cleaning. Additional data granularity might be useful, such as displaying the duration of individual cleaning sessions, rather than just the grand total of each day’s use. , The Thin-Q app displays when the battery attached to the vacuum is being charged and when it is fully charged. It does not provide any additional battery status data such as the remaining capacity of the battery (% remaining), and when charging, the progress of the charge (% charged – time remaining to 100%). There is no information provided for the second battery., One improvement that I believe would be beneficial and appreciated would be the addition of an LED display (with pushbutton) on the LG batteries. Every tool battery pack that I own has such a display. It is very convenient to be able to simply press the button momentarily and for the approximate current remaining charge level of the battery to be instantly displayed on the LED lamps., Air filtration is comprised of multiple filter elements and is listed as being 5 stage HEPA filtration. The filters are removable and washable. A spare pre-filter is also included. , The small dust collection bin can fill quickly. The CordZero A925 Kompressor employs a very unique lever operated “piston” to compress the dust and pet hair in the bin, thereby extending the intervals between emptying. A single press of the release latch quickly and neatly dumps the contents of the dust bin., I am hopeful that the CordZero A925 proves to be durable and reliable, but of course, only time will tell. The unit is comprised of a significant quantity of plastic components. The latch and hinge which secure the dust collection bin appear to potentially be fragile. Nevertheless, the vacuum appears to have a high quality build, with a solid feel and well made and nicely finished components. The LG CordZero A925 Kompressor is a high-quality stick vacuum!, Overall, the LG CordZero A925 Kompressor stick vacuum is excellent. It is compact, lightweight, easily maneuverable, and efficient. It is powerful, yet not unpleasantly noisy. It is well-equipped with accessories which attach and detach with ease, and all of which have dedicated storage places on the included charging/storage stand. The two large capacity batteries provide approximately two hours of run-time with the non-powered tools or approximately 80 minutes of operating time when used with the power nozzle, which is more than adequate for thoroughly cleaning a large house. The vacuum cleaning power and efficiency are great., I believe that you will be just as thoroughly pleased and satisfied with the excellent CordZero A925 Kompressor stick vacuum as we are with ours!]  \n1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           [Highly portable, yet powerful stick vacuum. The LG CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum is a great looking, relatively light vacuum cleaner which fits in nicely between our existing corded and robot vacuum cleaners., Unboxing and assembly seemed to take longer than I had anticipated, as some of the references in the quick-start and instructions referred to items that were not included in my set. It appears that there are three different flavors of this vacuum and although I am happy with mine, it had references to accessories, an accessory holder and mopping ability which this one does not have. Again, not a problem as I did not get the vacuum for mopping but it was a bit confusing at first to use the one-size-fits-all instructions., The manual advises charging the batteries before usage so I timed it and it was about an hour or so before the battery was fully charged. Once the vacuum charging mount is assembled, it provides a spot to charge the battery as well as dock the vacuum with its-on-board battery and both will charge in sequence. This means that once the primary battery runs out, you can just swap it out for the spare and then charge that one as you continue cleaning, doubling the effective running time. The vacuum itself will slide down the very top part of the mount and once settled there, it will charge the on-board battery as the other battery remains below, in its mount – very clever!, The charging mount can be free-standing or attached to a wall with the included mounting hardware. You can even dispense with the stand’s foot if you are wall mounting and don’t need to free-stand the vacuum. I am using the freestanding mount for now but will likely mount it later down the line., The stand includes two accessory mount points which securely hold the two included tools (crevice and soft brush). It means that the accessories are not with you as you clean but they are at least in an obvious storage spot. Even some corded standing vacuums don’t have the tools on board so this is not a big deal but I occasionally see something I wish I had the tool for and then have to really want it, to stop what I am doing and head back to base for the tool., The vacuum can join your Wi-Fi network and then the LG ThinQ app will track things like battery life, cleaning history and other interesting but not necessary data. For me, it is mostly a novelty but I do like when the app notifies me that the batteries are fully charged again., Using the vacuum is quite liberating. After years of cleaning a 2600 square foot home with various corded vacuums, it was eye-opening to take the same route with a cordless vacuum., With the universal floor tool attached, I found I was moving around quicker than with the corded. As the vacuum is lighter and did not have as aggressive beater bar inside the floor tool, I was concerned it wasn’t as powerful as the corded. It certainly leaves less obvious marks on the carpet but still seemed to collect the same amount of carpet fiber, pet hair and other debris. The manual had warned that the universal floor tool might be loud on hard surfaces but I did not really notice and it did fine on our mix of carpet, vinyl and laminate floor., Being able to just keep going where I would previously have to retrace my steps, in order not to exceed the power cord length was great. In addition, the Kompressor technology helps to reduce stops and visits to empty the debris cannister in the garbage. The Kompressor really is just a push button slide that pushes hair, carpet fiber etc. down near the bottom of the cannister so you can continue vacuuming for longer. I found it did reduce stops but did not really push it to the limit, in case it reduced cleaning power. It also helped keep the cannister cleaner as debris wasn’t able to just gather at the top although it remains to be seen if that will continue to work or dust will build up near the top over time. That said, the manual said you could wash out the cannister so it may not be an issue if you keep up with maintenance., I was able to do about three quarters of our house, including stairs, with a single battery on normal power. Occasionally I would boost the power to get something embedded in the carpet but did not need the turbo function yet. The LG documentation shows that the battery life is drastically reduced if you run it in the higher modes for too long so I was careful., Swapping batteries was painless other than the vacuum abruptly stopping and needing to walk back to the charging station to swap them over. I then had plenty of power to return upstairs and finish the last two rooms., The app kept track of running time and battery status as I cleaned which was interesting but not especially useful. Perhaps over time it could be but the jury is still out for me on the app right now. At worst, it might be helpful when it comes time to replace some of the consumable parts like filters and batteries, which LG warns will wear out and need to be replaced at some point., In summary, I am very happy with the portability and power of this vacuum and it seemed to be on par with the bigger, heavier corded vacuum we own. It could be run as a stick vacuum or you could remove the stick part and use it to clean stairs or inside a car, with lots of power and even more portability to get in smaller spaces. The battery life is good enough to clean a fairly large house, especially as it comes with two batteries and one can always be on charge. The Kompressor tech is useful but not especially glamorous – still makes it better than most cannisters in terms of keeping them clean and how often they need emptying before they affect the cyclone effect. , Great job LG!]  \n2

                          [LG CordZero A925KSM Cordless Stick Is A STANDOUT. This LG Cord Zero cordless stick vacuum with Kompressor technology comes with two batteries for extended run time and a clever dirt squisher., Kompressor technology is a clever built-in feature that compresses the dirt in the dust bin so it does not need to be emptied as often. Moving a lever is all it takes to squish the bin contents., Get up to 120 minutes of uninterrupted performance with a pair of included batteries. These batteries are said to be an upgraded lithium-ion design that can take repeated charges and discharges and come back for more., A portable charging stand is provided that holds the CordZero in place and does not require holes to be drilled into a wall, though wall mounting is an option., One-touch controls turn the vacuum on and off and adjust power levels up to Turbo mode with just a thumb. This should prove to be less strenuous on the hand., Telescope the wand for greater flexibility and to more conveniently store the unit away while taking up less space., Removable and washable filters extend the life of the vacuum. In addition, the cyclone system is removable and washable., A Smart Inverter Motor creates powerful suction and is backed by a 10-year limited warranty (the motor, not the batteries)., The ThinQ app for iOS and Android allows users to check on the vacuum’s cleaning history and perform product diagnostics., Convertible from a stick to a hand vac, clean floors, furniture and vehicle interiors. Use the included Universal Power Nozzle when in hand vac mode., LG CordZero is recommended for homes with minimal carpeting or rugs. It is not recommended for use on any fiber floor covering with medium to deep pile, the same as for any vacuum with a spinning brush head., **WHAT’S IN THE BOX**, • A925KSM CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum (Six pounds w/o accessories)\\n• Telescoping wand\\n• Universal Power Nozzle\\n• 2 Quick Release Batteries\\n• Portable Charging Station\\n• Crevice Tool\\n• Extra Pre-filter\\n• AC Power Adapter, **THE SETUP**, Manuals read, BOTH batteries charged (can take up to 240 minutes from fully discharged), it’s time to . . ., **PUT IT TO THE TEST**, A strong, not too loud, motor whir tells me this stick means business.There is plenty of suction even on the lowest power setting. Once it hits a low-pile rug, the power level should be increased for effectiveness, which it to be expected. , The Kompressor lever is a novel gimmick and it works. As the bin fills, the contents tend to coalesce near the cyclonic ports. Using the Kompressor lever allows the dirt, dust and other debris to be compressed and directed to the bottom of the bin so it does not appear to require emptying so frequently. Who thought of this clever idea?, Battery performance has been as expected, with both batteries providing enough power to clean everywhere. I like the ease-of-use when vacuuming inside our cars. , Easy to empty, and the simple, washable filter is very effective. There are no consumables to deal with on a regular basis, though the filters will degrade over time. The batteries will eventually need to be replaced. Of equal importance is that the design does not create the need for unusual and unplanned deep cleaning of the CordZero itself., The brush head is easy to dismantle for removal of anything wrapped around the brush. A quarter-turn of the red screw on the bottom releases the cover for brush head access., There have been no clogs to remove., The Wi-Fi-enabled ThinQ App’s monitoring shows a detailed cleaning history and other stats but is, in my mind, a feature that is not so important or relevant to this reviewer., Everyone here is pretty impressed with this LG CordZero., **CONCLUSION**, Easy to set up. Easy to use. Easy to like, even love. Very easy to recommend., **WARRANTY**, Manufacturer’s one year warranty from the date of the original purchase, and 10 years on the Smart Inverter Motor]  \n3

compact stick vacuum!. Compact, bagless, super light and yet a powerful stick vacuum with tons of features. It came with an extra battery and an extra pre-filter along with a combination and crevice tool. The first thing I noticed on this superlight stick vacuum is the adjustable or telescopic wand and the Kompressor lever. The standalone charging base has an option to charge the second battery. The batteries themselves are compact and each battery is good for 60 min operation. , Design:  Small form factor with a base station to charge the stick vacuum and the additional battery. The charging station or the base is heavy enough to hold the stick vacuum in place and I didn't have to worry about drilling holes in the walls to keep it secure. It does come with a wall mount option as well. I like the telescopic wand, lets me get under the furniture and everyone in my house including the kids can use it. The best part is the Kompressor lever that really compresses the dirt and keeps the filter free of debris. It will be a while before I have to empty the bin. It also helps clean the bin and not have to worry about getting your fingers in to pull the debris out- good thinking LG! The filters can be removed easily and washed in the sink. The best part is the roller or the brush head that can be easily removed by just twisting one end, and it slides right out. The roller has minimalist design, can twist, and turn easily to go around the corners and is powerful enough to pick up fine debris, and they are so easy to clean! The cyclone head slides right out as well and can be easily cleaned and washed in the sink. I started using this vacuum over other cordless ones that I have, just because of its design and the ease with which it can be cleaned. All the controls on the vacuum can be easily accessed with your thumb. I downloaded the LG ThinQ app to monitor its usage and diagnose issues right on the phone. I like the turbo mode option, gives me the ability to crank up the suction power to deep clean my rugs! I noticed the battery life reduce quite a bit (think about 20 mins) when I had the turbo mode on. The vacuum has three suction levels - normal, power, and turbo. The turbo mode definitely does get the job done when it comes to picking up fine dust. , Function:  Coming to the suction power, I was impressed on how good it was it in picking up the fine dust from the rugs. The five-stage filtration system speaks for itself when you see the bin filled with fine dust! I live in a dry state and dust accumulation is a major problem and I can see using this vacuum every other day. It worked great on carpet and on hardwood floors and my only complaint was it has a small opening in the front, and it struggles to pick up large debris on the hardwood floors. , Overall, I highly recommend this powerful vacuum just for the fact it has good suction power and ease of maintenance. It literally took me less than 10 minutes to clean the filter and the cyclone head, empty the dust bin, and clean the debris off the roller. It’s a little expensive but is comparable to the name brand ones on the suction power, but definitely beats the rest on ease of maintenance. I had it for over 2 weeks and used it every other day and happy with its suction power and battery life!]  \n4

I have several vacuum cleaners, even though I don’t really enjoy vacuuming. I like the end result, but the actual process of vacuuming is a chore. I have never used a cordless stick vacuum like this LG one though. This vacuum is pretty quiet, which is saying a lot since I think most vacuum cleaners are loud as heck. And the air that blows out when I use it isn’t hot air. That is one of the big negatives about my standard stand up vac. I get so hot and sweaty whenever I use it, not just from pushing it around but the hot air that blows on me the whole time. This one is so effortless, it’s weird. I actually enjoy using it., This LG came with a wall-mount stand for the vac, but at this point, I’m not going to be installing that permanently on my wall somewhere. I have shared a picture of how to charge this vac if you chose to go unmounted like me. This vac came with a regular nozzle, combination tool, crevice tool and a cleaning brush. The cleaning brush is a nice touch because I really can get up and in the dirt cup with it to dislodge some of the hair that doesn’t want to fall out when I open the latch. It also came with an extra prefilter, which is nice. That has to be washed once in a while so it can be switched out and you can keep on vacuuming while one is hanging to dry. This vac comes with two batteries, so you can always have a backup. This vac comes with a nice maintenance guide which feels like a plastic sheet. It has a little suction cup so you can stick it somewhere to be able to reference as needed. There are several things you can do to keep this vac stick in good operating mode, so this is a good tool to remind you. I myself find it very satisfying to pop open the dirt cup and dump it into the trash can. , I really like this stick vac to suck up the hair on my bathroom floor. With my regular push vac, it always sucks up the rugs that I have in there and it’s a pain. With this stick I just sweep with it and my rugs don’t get disturbed. There is a turbo power button for extra vacuum power. I use that when I can but definitely do just fine with regular mode on the tile floor. If I had just hard surface floors I could see just owning this vac stick. It’s so easy to use. The extension pipe that connects the nozzle to the vac unit can be used with the other tools, and it extends. If you are short or tall it can be adjusted to your liking. This is also very good for vacuuming up at the ceiling level, etc. It is very nice to be cordless. This is also nice for left handed users. Half of my family is left handed, but not me. I pay a lot of attention to how right handed everything is, and since this is cordless, it’s going to be easier to use with either hand., I connected this to my LG ThinQ app, it wasn’t too difficult. I already had the app because I have an LG smart TV, but for some reason, that isn’t on the app anymore and I couldn’t reconnect it. I’ll work on that later. Why connect a vacuum cleaner to a smart app? Well, it lets me know when my battery is finished charging. That’s actually very nice. It also tells me how many times someone has used the vac, and for how long. So if you want to keep tabs on that, here you go. Multiple people can share this info, they can all download the app.]  ",

The LG CordZero A925KSM Kompressor Stick Vacuum is similar to some other LG cordless vacuum models, and that is a very good thing. The LG A925KSM is an excellent cordless stick vacuum that performs very well and is very pleasant and easy to use., The LG CordZero A925KSM Kompressor arrives very well packed and includes the vacuum motor power head, an aluminum telescoping extension wand (20” collapsed, 29.5” extended), a universal power nozzle (for carpet and bare floors), a combination tool (with removable brush), a crevice tool, a free-standing / wall mountable, portable storage stand with integral battery charger, two lithium ion rechargeable batteries, a spare pre-filter for the motor and a small brush for cleaning the dirt collection canister and motor housing., Assembly of the charging stand is straightforward, and LG provides a quantity of printed product documentation. The stand has a weighted base, which I found to be very stable. The stand may also be wall mounted. The hardware for wall attachment is included. Notably, all of the included components and accessories are accommodated on the charging stand! , The combination tool and crevice tool attachments can be used with or without the telescoping extension wand, easily accommodating cleaning out of reach areas, as well as close-up cleaning tasks such as upholstered furniture. The telescoping wand provides four latching positions. All of the attachments easily snap together and latch securely., Cordless stick vacuums are particularly attractive and desirable for their light weight, easy maneuverability and superior convenience. The LG CordZero A925 Kompressor excels in those attributes. , The vacuum weighs only 5.95 lbs, with most of the weight concentrated in the motor unit and battery. The handle is large and comfortable. The thumb operated power on/off switch and motor speed control switches (+ / -) are conveniently located and easily operated. Switches only require momentary depression and do not need to be held continuously during operation as some stick vacuums require., The power vacuum nozzle is equipped with a ball-gimbal mount which affords outstanding maneuverability and directional control. The CordZero easily reaches under low furniture, and is easily maneuvered next to walls and furnishings for excellent edge cleaning., The power vacuum nozzle contains a motorized 9” brushroll which operates at all times for both carpeted and hard surface floors. A pair of small rollers facilitates movement on carpeting, but nevertheless, there are times when forward motion required additional physical effort. I found that a high angle of attack exacerbated that issue, and lowering the angle of the stick vacuum reduced the level of required effort. However, I also found that lowering the angle of attack often necessitates bending slightly to lower the handle/stick. This created an occasional annoyance. This issue does not result from the telescoping extension wand being too short. Rather, it is a product of the design of the leading edge of the of the power nozzle which can embed in carpet pile., LG provides a specification of 200 watts of suction power. If LG is actually describing an air watts rating, 200 watts is double the required 100 air watt standard for upright vacuums, and is only slightly below the 220 air watt standard for canister vacuums., I found the suction power to be more than adequate. The CordZero A925 provides three motor speeds (power levels) labeled as Normal, Power and Turbo. The default, Normal mode proved to be extremely effective on both hard and carpeted surfaces. The Power and Turbo motor speeds reduce battery run-time and increase noise level., LG claims 40 minutes of operation (per battery) in Normal mode, 20 minutes in Power mode and 6 minutes in Turbo mode when using the floor cleaning Universal Power Nozzle. When used with a non-powered tool, the claimed operating times are 60 minutes in Normal mode, 30 minutes in Power mode and 7 minutes in Turbo mode. When used with the power nozzle the claimed run times are 40 minutes in Normal mode, 20 minutes in Power mode and 6 minutes in Turbo mode. Using two fully charged batteries provides for doubling of the foregoing operating times. The power unit of the vacuum has an LED display with 3 incremental bars for battery capacity. After using the LG A925 several times, we believe that with the two included batteries, whole house cleaning is well within expectations., The lithium ion, batteries are 25.9 volt, 2.4 Ah / 62.16 Wh (2.3 Ah / 59.57 Wh minimum) capacity. Replacement batteries are expensive so they should be properly maintained. Battery charging is accommodated by charging one battery while attached to the vacuum motor unit as well as the second battery in the charging stand. Batteries are not charged simultaneously; they are charged sequentially. The charging stand first charges the battery which is attached to the vacuum, and upon completion, then charges the second battery in the stand. Each battery requires approximately 4 hours to fully charge (8 hours to charge both batteries)., Completion of charging of each battery is annunciated by LED indicators (3 incremental LED bars on the vacuum handle for attached battery, and a single LED on the charging stand for second battery). Completed charging of the primary battery is also annunciated by a push-notification to the available LG Thin-Q smartphone app. The built-in LED panel also shows the progress of charging, the need for filter cleaning, detection of a clogged vacuum flow-path and indicates if Wi-Fi is active., I already had the Thin-Q app installed on my LG smartphone. Nevertheless, it required a few attempts to finally connect the vacuum with the app via wi-fi. The CordZero communicates only on 2.4GHz wi-fi., The Thin-Q app tracks usage of the CordZero by date and cleaning sessions, reporting total hours/minutes of use. It also displays the duration of use in each of the three power modes, and notifies the user when filters require cleaning. Additional data granularity might be useful, such as displaying the duration of individual cleaning sessions, rather than just the grand total of each day’s use. , The Thin-Q app displays when the battery attached to the vacuum is being charged and when it is fully charged. It does not provide any additional battery status data such as the remaining capacity of the battery (% remaining), and when charging, the progress of the charge (% charged – time remaining to 100%). There is no information provided for the second battery., One improvement that I believe would be beneficial and appreciated would be the addition of an LED display (with pushbutton) on the LG batteries. Every tool battery pack that I own has such a display. It is very convenient to be able to simply press the button momentarily and for the approximate current remaining charge level of the battery to be instantly displayed on the LED lamps., Air filtration is comprised of multiple filter elements and is listed as being 5 stage HEPA filtration. The filters are removable and washable. A spare pre-filter is also included. , The small dust collection bin can fill quickly. The CordZero A925 Kompressor employs a very unique lever operated “piston” to compress the dust and pet hair in the bin, thereby extending the intervals between emptying. A single press of the release latch quickly and neatly dumps the contents of the dust bin., I am hopeful that the CordZero A925 proves to be durable and reliable, but of course, only time will tell. The unit is comprised of a significant quantity of plastic components. The latch and hinge which secure the dust collection bin appear to potentially be fragile. Nevertheless, the vacuum appears to have a high quality build, with a solid feel and well made and nicely finished components. The LG CordZero A925 Kompressor is a high-quality stick vacuum!, Overall, the LG CordZero A925 Kompressor stick vacuum is excellent. It is compact, lightweight, easily maneuverable, and efficient. It is powerful, yet not unpleasantly noisy. It is well-equipped with accessories which attach and detach with ease, and all of which have dedicated storage places on the included charging/storage stand. The two large capacity batteries provide approximately two hours of run-time with the non-powered tools or approximately 80 minutes of operating time when used with the power nozzle, which is more than adequate for thoroughly cleaning a large house. The vacuum cleaning power and efficiency are great., I believe that you will be just as thoroughly pleased and satisfied with the excellent CordZero A925 Kompressor stick vacuum as we are with ours!]</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>[Highly portable, yet powerful stick vacuum. The LG CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum is a great looking, relatively light vacuum cleaner which fits in nicely between our existing corded and robot vacuum cleaners., Unboxing and assembly seemed to take longer than I had anticipated, as some of the references in the quick-start and instructions referred to items that were not included in my set. It appears that there are three different flavors of this vacuum and although I am happy with mine, it had references to accessories, an accessory holder and mopping ability which this one does not have. Again, not a problem as I did not get the vacuum for mopping but it was a bit confusing at first to use the one-size-fits-all instructions., The manual advises charging the batteries before usage so I timed it and it was about an hour or so before the battery was fully charged. Once the vacuum charging mount is assembled, it provides a spot to charge the battery as well as dock the vacuum with its-on-board battery and both will charge in sequence. This means that once the primary battery runs out, you can just swap it out for the spare and then charge that one as you continue cleaning, doubling the effective running time. The vacuum itself will slide down the very top part of the mount and once settled there, it will charge the on-board battery as the other battery remains below, in its mount – very clever!, The charging mount can be free-standing or attached to a wall with the included mounting hardware. You can even dispense with the stand’s foot if you are wall mounting and don’t need to free-stand the vacuum. I am using the freestanding mount for now but will likely mount it later down the line., The stand includes two accessory mount points which securely hold the two included tools (crevice and soft brush). It means that the accessories are not with you as you clean but they are at least in an obvious storage spot. Even some corded standing vacuums don’t have the tools on board so this is not a big deal but I occasionally see something I wish I had the tool for and then have to really want it, to stop what I am doing and head back to base for the tool., The vacuum can join your Wi-Fi network and then the LG ThinQ app will track things like battery life, cleaning history and other interesting but not necessary data. For me, it is mostly a novelty but I do like when the app notifies me that the batteries are fully charged again., Using the vacuum is quite liberating. After years of cleaning a 2600 square foot home with various corded vacuums, it was eye-opening to take the same route with a cordless vacuum., With the universal floor tool attached, I found I was moving around quicker than with the corded. As the vacuum is lighter and did not have as aggressive beater bar inside the floor tool, I was concerned it wasn’t as powerful as the corded. It certainly leaves less obvious marks on the carpet but still seemed to collect the same amount of carpet fiber, pet hair and other debris. The manual had warned that the universal floor tool might be loud on hard surfaces but I did not really notice and it did fine on our mix of carpet, vinyl and laminate floor., Being able to just keep going where I would previously have to retrace my steps, in order not to exceed the power cord length was great. In addition, the Kompressor technology helps to reduce stops and visits to empty the debris cannister in the garbage. The Kompressor really is just a push button slide that pushes hair, carpet fiber etc. down near the bottom of the cannister so you can continue vacuuming for longer. I found it did reduce stops but did not really push it to the limit, in case it reduced cleaning power. It also helped keep the cannister cleaner as debris wasn’t able to just gather at the top although it remains to be seen if that will continue to work or dust will build up near the top over time. That said, the manual said you could wash out the cannister so it may not be an issue if you keep up with maintenance., I was able to do about three quarters of our house, including stairs, with a single battery on normal power. Occasionally I would boost the power to get something embedded in the carpet but did not need the turbo function yet. The LG documentation shows that the battery life is drastically reduced if you run it in the higher modes for too long so I was careful., Swapping batteries was painless other than the vacuum abruptly stopping and needing to walk back to the charging station to swap them over. I then had plenty of power to return upstairs and finish the last two rooms., The app kept track of running time and battery status as I cleaned which was interesting but not especially useful. Perhaps over time it could be but the jury is still out for me on the app right now. At worst, it might be helpful when it comes time to replace some of the consumable parts like filters and batteries, which LG warns will wear out and need to be replaced at some point., In summary, I am very happy with the portability and power of this vacuum and it seemed to be on par with the bigger, heavier corded vacuum we own. It could be run as a stick vacuum or you could remove the stick part and use it to clean stairs or inside a car, with lots of power and even more portability to get in smaller spaces. The battery life is good enough to clean a fairly large house, especially as it comes with two batteries and one can always be on charge. The Kompressor tech is useful but not especially glamorous – still makes it better than most cannisters in terms of keeping them clean and how often they need emptying before they affect the cyclone effect. , Great job LG!]</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>[LG CordZero A925KSM Cordless Stick Is A STANDOUT. This LG Cord Zero cordless stick vacuum with Kompressor technology comes with two batteries for extended run time and a clever dirt squisher., Kompressor technology is a clever built-in feature that compresses the dirt in the dust bin so it does not need to be emptied as often. Moving a lever is all it takes to squish the bin contents., Get up to 120 minutes of uninterrupted performance with a pair of included batteries. These batteries are said to be an upgraded lithium-ion design that can take repeated charges and discharges and come back for more., A portable charging stand is provided that holds the CordZero in place and does not require holes to be drilled into a wall, though wall mounting is an option., One-touch controls turn the vacuum on and off and adjust power levels up to Turbo mode with just a thumb. This should prove to be less strenuous on the hand., Telescope the wand for greater flexibility and to more conveniently store the unit away while taking up less space., Removable and washable filters extend the life of the vacuum. In addition, the cyclone system is removable and washable., A Smart Inverter Motor creates powerful suction and is backed by a 10-year limited warranty (the motor, not the batteries)., The ThinQ app for iOS and Android allows users to check on the vacuum’s cleaning history and perform product diagnostics., Convertible from a stick to a hand vac, clean floors, furniture and vehicle interiors. Use the included Universal Power Nozzle when in hand vac mode., LG CordZero is recommended for homes with minimal carpeting or rugs. It is not recommended for use on any fiber floor covering with medium to deep pile, the same as for any vacuum with a spinning brush head., **WHAT’S IN THE BOX**, • A925KSM CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum (Six pounds w/o accessories)\\n• Telescoping wand\\n• Universal Power Nozzle\\n• 2 Quick Release Batteries\\n• Portable Charging Station\\n• Crevice Tool\\n• Extra Pre-filter\\n• AC Power Adapter, **THE SETUP**, Manuals read, BOTH batteries charged (can take up to 240 minutes from fully discharged), it’s time to . . ., **PUT IT TO THE TEST**, A strong, not too loud, motor whir tells me this stick means business.There is plenty of suction even on the lowest power setting. Once it hits a low-pile rug, the power level should be increased for effectiveness, which it to be expected. , The Kompressor lever is a novel gimmick and it works. As the bin fills, the contents tend to coalesce near the cyclonic ports. Using the Kompressor lever allows the dirt, dust and other debris to be compressed and directed to the bottom of the bin so it does not appear to require emptying so frequently. Who thought of this clever idea?, Battery performance has been as expected, with both batteries providing enough power to clean everywhere. I like the ease-of-use when vacuuming inside our cars. , Easy to empty, and the simple, washable filter is very effective. There are no consumables to deal with on a regular basis, though the filters will degrade over time. The batteries will eventually need to be replaced. Of equal importance is that the design does not create the need for unusual and unplanned deep cleaning of the CordZero itself., The brush head is easy to dismantle for removal of anything wrapped around the brush. A quarter-turn of the red screw on the bottom releases the cover for brush head access., There have been no clogs to remove., The Wi-Fi-enabled ThinQ App’s monitoring shows a detailed cleaning history and other stats but is, in my mind, a feature that is not so important or relevant to this reviewer., Everyone here is pretty impressed with this LG CordZero., **CONCLUSION**, Easy to set up. Easy to use. Easy to like, even love. Very easy to recommend., **WARRANTY**, Manufacturer’s one year warranty from the date of the original purchase, and 10 years on the Smart Inverter Motor]</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>[Powerful compact stick vacuum!. Compact, bagless, super light and yet a powerful stick vacuum with tons of features. It came with an extra battery and an extra pre-filter along with a combination and crevice tool. The first thing I noticed on this superlight stick vacuum is the adjustable or telescopic wand and the Kompressor lever. The standalone charging base has an option to charge the second battery. The batteries themselves are compact and each battery is good for 60 min operation. , Design:  Small form factor with a base station to charge the stick vacuum and the additional battery. The charging station or the base is heavy enough to hold the stick vacuum in place and I didn't have to worry about drilling holes in the walls to keep it secure. It does come with a wall mount option as well. I like the telescopic wand, lets me get under the furniture and everyone in my house including the kids can use it. The best part is the Kompressor lever that really compresses the dirt and keeps the filter free of debris. It will be a while before I have to empty the bin. It also helps clean the bin and not have to worry about getting your fingers in to pull the debris out- good thinking LG! The filters can be removed easily and washed in the sink. The best part is the roller or the brush head that can be easily removed by just twisting one end, and it slides right out. The roller has minimalist design, can twist, and turn easily to go around the corners and is powerful enough to pick up fine debris, and they are so easy to clean! The cyclone head slides right out as well and can be easily cleaned and washed in the sink. I started using this vacuum over other cordless ones that I have, just because of its design and the ease with which it can be cleaned. All the controls on the vacuum can be easily accessed with your thumb. I downloaded the LG ThinQ app to monitor its usage and diagnose issues right on the phone. I like the turbo mode option, gives me the ability to crank up the suction power to deep clean my rugs! I noticed the battery life reduce quite a bit (think about 20 mins) when I had the turbo mode on. The vacuum has three suction levels - normal, power, and turbo. The turbo mode definitely does get the job done when it comes to picking up fine dust. , Function:  Coming to the suction power, I was impressed on how good it was it in picking up the fine dust from the rugs. The five-stage filtration system speaks for itself when you see the bin filled with fine dust! I live in a dry state and dust accumulation is a major problem and I can see using this vacuum every other day. It worked great on carpet and on hardwood floors and my only complaint was it has a small opening in the front, and it struggles to pick up large debris on the hardwood floors. , Overall, I highly recommend this powerful vacuum just for the fact it has good suction power and ease of maintenance. It literally took me less than 10 minutes to clean the filter and the cyclone head, empty the dust bin, and clean the debris off the roller. It’s a little expensive but is comparable to the name brand ones on the suction power, but definitely beats the rest on ease of maintenance. I had it for over 2 weeks and used it every other day and happy with its suction power and battery life!]</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>4</td>\n      <td>5</td>\n      <td>[Nice experience!.

I get so hot and sweaty whenever I use it, not just from pushing it around but the hot air that blows on me the whole time. This one is so effortless, it’s weird. I actually enjoy using it., This LG came with a wall-mount stand for the vac, but at this point, I’m not going to be installing that permanently on my wall somewhere. I have shared a picture of how to charge this vac if you chose to go unmounted like me. This vac came with a regular nozzle, combination tool, crevice tool and a cleaning brush. The cleaning brush is a nice touch because I really can get up and in the dirt cup with it to dislodge some of the hair that doesn’t want to fall out when I open the latch. It also came with an extra prefilter, which is nice. That has to be washed once in a while so it can be switched out and you can keep on vacuuming while one is hanging to dry. This vac comes with two batteries, so you can always have a backup. This vac comes with a nice maintenance guide which feels like a plastic sheet. It has a little suction cup so you can stick it somewhere to be able to reference as needed. There are several things you can do to keep this vac stick in good operating mode, so this is a good tool to remind you. I myself find it very satisfying to pop open the dirt cup and dump it into the trash can. , I really like this stick vac to suck up the hair on my bathroom floor. With my regular push vac, it always sucks up the rugs that I have in there and it’s a pain. With this stick I just sweep with it and my rugs don’t get disturbed. There is a turbo power button for extra vacuum power. I use that when I can but definitely do just fine with regular mode on the tile floor. If I had just hard surface floors I could see just owning this vac stick. It’s so easy to use. The extension pipe that connects the nozzle to the vac unit can be used with the other tools, and it extends. If you are short or tall it can be adjusted to your liking. This is also very good for vacuuming up at the ceiling level, etc. It is very nice to be cordless. This is also nice for left handed users. Half of my family is left handed, but not me. I pay a lot of attention to how right handed everything is, and since this is cordless, it’s going to be easier to use with either hand., I connected this to my LG ThinQ app, it wasn’t too difficult. I already had the app because I have an LG smart TV, but for some reason, that isn’t on the app anymore and I couldn’t reconnect it. I’ll work on that later. Why connect a vacuum cleaner to a smart app? Well, it lets me know when my battery is finished charging. That’s actually very nice. It also tells me how many times someone has used the vac, and for how long. So if you want to keep tabs on that, here you go. Multiple people can share this info, they can all download the app.]</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"

The LG CordZero A925KSM Kompressor Stick Vacuum is similar to some other LG cordless vacuum models, and that is a very good thing. The LG A925KSM is an excellent cordless stick vacuum that performs very well and is very pleasant and easy to use.  \n1     The LG CordZero A925KSM Kompressor arrives very well packed and includes the vacuum motor power head, an aluminum telescoping extension wand (20” collapsed, 29.5” extended), a universal power nozzle (for carpet and bare floors), a combination tool (with removable brush), a crevice tool, a free-standing / wall mountable, portable storage stand with integral battery charger, two lithium ion rechargeable batteries, a spare pre-filter for the motor and a small brush for cleaning the dirt collection canister and motor housing.  \n2                                                                                                                                                                                  Assembly of the charging stand is straightforward, and LG provides a quantity of printed product documentation. The stand has a weighted base, which I found to be very stable. The stand may also be wall mounted. The hardware for wall attachment is included. Notably, all of the included components and accessories are accommodated on the charging stand!   \n3                                                                                                                                                                                            The combination tool and crevice tool attachments can be used with or without the telescoping extension wand, easily accommodating cleaning out of reach areas, as well as close-up cleaning tasks such as upholstered furniture. The telescoping wand provides four latching positions. All of the attachments easily snap together and latch securely.  \n4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Cordless stick vacuums are particularly attractive and desirable for their light weight, easy maneuverability and superior convenience.

The LG CordZero A925KSM Kompressor Stick Vacuum is similar to some other LG cordless vacuum models, and that is a very good thing. The LG A925KSM is an excellent cordless stick vacuum that performs very well and is very pleasant and easy to use.  \n1     The LG CordZero A925KSM Kompressor arrives very well packed and includes the vacuum motor power head, an aluminum telescoping extension wand (20” collapsed, 29.5” extended), a universal power nozzle (for carpet and bare floors), a combination tool (with removable brush), a crevice tool, a free-standing / wall mountable, portable storage stand with integral battery charger, two lithium ion rechargeable batteries, a spare pre-filter for the motor and a small brush for cleaning the dirt collection canister and motor housing.  \n2                                                                                                                                                                                  Assembly of the charging stand is straightforward, and LG provides a quantity of printed product documentation. The stand has a weighted base, which I found to be very stable. The stand may also be wall mounted. The hardware for wall attachment is included. Notably, all of the included components and accessories are accommodated on the charging stand!   \n3                                                                                                                                                                                            The combination tool and crevice tool attachments can be used with or without the telescoping extension wand, easily accommodating cleaning out of reach areas, as well as close-up cleaning tasks such as upholstered furniture. The telescoping wand provides four latching positions. All of the attachments easily snap together and latch securely.  \n4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Cordless stick vacuums are particularly attractive and desirable for their light weight, easy maneuverability and superior convenience.

The LG CordZero A925KSM Kompressor Stick Vacuum is similar to some other LG cordless vacuum models, and that is a very good thing. The LG A925KSM is an excellent cordless stick vacuum that performs very well and is very pleasant and easy to use.  \n1  The LG CordZero A925KSM Kompressor arrives very well packed and includes the vacuum motor power head, an aluminum telescoping extension wand (20” collapsed, 29.5” extended), a universal power nozzle (for carpet and bare floors), a combination tool (with removable brush), a crevice tool, a free-standing / wall mountable, portable storage stand with integral battery charger, two lithium ion rechargeable batteries, a spare pre-filter for the motor and a small brush for cleaning the dirt collection canister and motor housing.  \n2                                                                                                                                                                               Assembly of the charging stand is straightforward, and LG provides a quantity of printed product documentation. The stand has a weighted base, which I found to be very stable. The stand may also be wall mounted. The hardware for wall attachment is included.
