Amazing suction,1,1,0,0,0,0
"Power: The small size also forces a smaller suction motor. While the motor is probably very good for its size, overall it can be lacking a bit. I found that the suction is much stronger with the UV head on beds and furniture than the roller head for floors.",1,1,0,0,0,0

"This vacuum is a bit too heavy. The top section, where the motor and battery are, weighs 4 lbs. 8 oz. That’s quite a bit of weight on top. After a few minutes, you’ll find yourself needing to use two hands to move the vacuum around. The other drawback to having so much weight on top is that it throws the balance off. People are used to the weight on the bottom nozzle where the suction happens and when it’s the opposite it introduces usability issues such as having to make sure you keep the floor nozzle grounded as you’re prone to lifting it up due to the unnatural weight distribution.",1,0,1,0,0,0
