amazon,LG A939KBGS,4,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 27, 2023",David M Haubert,Needs more suction,Very cool but costly stick vac. Esthetically it's beautiful.  The auto empty feature is also awesome  but you really need additional suction to get anything done which uses up the battery quicker. Luckily it has 3 different suction options. These could be asier to obtain but works well once you get there. Another draw was the mop attachment which I was not impressed with at all.
amazon,LG A939KBGS,4,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 4, 2023",Amazon Customer,No headlight,"Love this vacuum!  I only gave it 4 stars because for $1,000 I expected it to have a headlight.  I bought it before they reduced the price."
amazon,LG A939KBGS,5,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 30, 2023",Julez119,If loving a vac is possible .. you gotta meet this one,It’s great so worth the money I just wish I would have found this before buying other nameless brands. Really like everything about this LG thought of every possible situation someone cleaning there home could need and put it nicely in this awesome package.  It’s an investment well worth it
amazon,LG A939KBGS,4,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 16, 2023",Shoreguy70,Good concept just needs some small improvements,Battery life could be better. App is cool but doesn’t work all the time. Pricing also seems to fluctuate a bit so you may want to wait for a deal on this one.
amazon,LG A939KBGS,5,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 22, 2023",parker geiger,Awesome!,"Love Love Love this...the self-cleaning is best. I typically just remove the dirt from the internal throw away bags to save money, but honestly, I may not do that every time. It's lightweight, goes under the furniture well. GREAT suction. Once the tank gets full, I self-clean and back to work I go. I wish I had gotten the extra insurance, just in case, because it is a big investment. So far, LG has NOT disappointed in washing machines. So I feel confident; however, get the extra insurnace on any expensive appliances. Love the compact housing unit. Love how it hangs up well and easily. Love the back up battery and love that it charges while in the unit. Have not tried the water cleaning yet, but will soon and let you know."
amazon,LG A939KBGS,4,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 21, 2022",Kim,I like it,"I’ll start by saying, I’d never have bought myself this vacuum as it is pretty cost prohibitive. My mother bought it for me as a gift and I’ve been pleasantly surprised. It has better suction than I expected it would. And since it is lightweight, I grab it almost everyday instead of a broom for my tile floors and instead of my bulky vacuum for carpets.By far, the most valuable feature is the fact that u don’t have to open that canister to empty it out. I’ve had other stick vacuums in the past that, while emptying it, I usually felt that I was just spreading all the contents around again. When u dock this vacuum, all the contents r sucked into an internal bag. My FAVORITE feature.I have 2 greyhounds that seem to continuously shed fur. So the ability to grab this vacuum rather push the fur around with a broom is much better.I’ve never tried the mop feature as it seems sort of pointless to me…which is maybe why this thing is priced so high.Like I said, I would never pay $1000 for a vacuum… but I LOVE the self-emptying feature… and it’s suction power will surprise!"

amazon,LG A939KBGS,3,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 17, 2022",graywolf54,Great...but not with pets,"This vacuum is really a very good product. It is light, does a good job on carpet and hard surfaces, and the auto-clean of the container is a nice feature. However, we have a Labrador retriever, and this product unfortunately continually clogs on her fur. Running the vacuum on max ""turbo"" helps reduce the clogging to a more manageable level - but you still have to periodically reach into the inlet and ""hook"" the fur out to unclog the device.The auto-clean feature also has trouble with pet fur. It either cannot remove it from the canister, or worse, it removes it from the canister but leaves it in the opening to the collection bag so it all falls on the floor when you remove the vacuum from the stand. We have even found the canister lid left open after the clean cycle because all the fur didn't get out - and the remaining contents all fell on the floor.We like the vacuum enough to keep experimenting with it - it's just somewhat disappointing that it handles pet fur so poorly. Rated it three stars because it is a good device, minus pet fur."
amazon,LG A939KBGS,5,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 30, 2023",Michael Campos,Great vacuum and very light weight.,"Great vacuum and very light weight. Works on both my carpet and on the tile floors to clean off the dirt before mopping. So far, the battery seems to power it just fine and I can do the whole house with one battery and still have some charge left."
amazon,LG A939KBGS,5,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 24, 2022",Terry J. Keaton,Expensive but with value - little update,"We have gone through all kinds of vacuums, corded, cordless, and robot. Still have a corded Dyson for deep, heavy cleaning. Went through the latest Dyson V11, nice machine but connections on the stick were weak, started breaking. Went to the new Shark, nice but loud. Worked well, a bit heavy. Saw a commercial for this LG and checked it out. After all their TV and oven we have are exceptional. Turns out the vacuum is pretty nifty too. Yeah, expensive, but the technology and abilities make it worth it. It has two batteries, so use time is extended a long time. It is very lightweight, surprisingly so. The suction is strong, no problem picking up bird seed, popcorn, and other normal carpet detritus. No switch to push between carpet and flooring. The fringe on the carpet has not (yet) gotten caught up, even after pushing it up more than halfway. That actually straightens out the fringe. Easy to lift over because of the lack of weight. So far haven’t needed to use the compact button, would take a lot of vacuuming to fill it up enough. Really nice to just stick it in the stand and have the dirt get automatically sucked out and into a bag. Simple to put together, just put on the non-skid tape, set the unit on the base, plug it in, attach accessories. Just wish there was some storage for the floor mops. Ended up velcroing the bag on the back of the stand. Also need a place to stick extra bags so I don’t forget where they are. Yep, really big complaints there. We believe this was well worth the cost.Little update concerning fringe. Purposely ran over the fringe numerous times from both sides. Was cringing, expecting screaming noise an stoppage from jamming. Nope, cringing unnecessarily, nothing happened. The fringe got sucked in, could see it kind of flapping on top of the brush, but no loud noise and no stopping or even slowing. Gee, impressed even more."
amazon,LG A939KBGS,2,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 13, 2022",Soso,LG Vacuum warranty service is terrible.,"Let me TLDR this real quick.  The vacuum is great, when it works... My base unit broke and this is the story of my warranty service....I bought this unit a month ago and not soon after I got it the base unit stopped working.  I called LG support and was transferred to India or the Philippines or whatever where a representative(who barely spoke english) made me run through a bunch of ""troubleshooting"" procedures ending with, ""Now you have to unplug the unit, wait an hour and call us back""  As ridiculous as this was I did it, and sure enough called back the next day where once again I had to do all of the same troubleshooting again until I finally got fed up and told them either set up an exchange or I am going to return it to the retailer(Amazon).  The guy actually told me that's exactly what I should do(as in return it to the retailer).  Never heard of this in my life....  Anyways, since the vacuum was actually still working (just the base was broken) I asked why can't I get the base fixed?  So after another 30 minutes I was offered what is the only option for service on these.  You have to pack the ENTIRE thing back up(the box is HUGE), ship it back to them, wait up to two weeks for them to fix it and then they will send it back.  They said the whole process can take up to a month.... This is ridiculous, every large company these days will either send you a replacement right away and put a hold on your credit card so you send the old one back or they will at least let you ship it back and when they get it, send you a new one out again, but these guys want hold on to your broken one for a couple weeks while they try to fix it.... Ridiculous.  The vacuum is good when it works but I won't buy another until they change their warranty policy and stop farming out their customer service to people who don't understand you and vice versa."
amazon,LG A939KBGS,5,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 17, 2023",Tara Looney,The vacuum works,"Really Liked: lightweight, long battery, station very helpful along with the collection bag.Disliked: inconvenient mop feature. It works okay (not great) but the time it takes to get it all together, may as well have a better product separate from the vacuum"
amazon,LG A939KBGS,3,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 24, 2023",Yesica Gonzalez,Beautiful Not Practical,"This vacuum was stunning but who wants a vacuum just for looks? I sent mine back, way too expensive and Not practical to clean up a mess."
amazon,LG A939KBGS,3,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 7, 2023",Big daddy,Easy to use,Suction is decent but not that good
amazon,LG A939KBGS,5,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 24, 2023",Amazon Customers wife,Easiest ever,"This is the best& easiest sweeper ever. Good everywhere you want it to. No moving furniture or chairs, I wish I would have bought it years ago, no wasting $$ on others. No complaints here. The packaging was so simple, this unit also emptied itself. I am so happy my husband bought it for me ❤️"
amazon,LG A939KBGS,3,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 4, 2023",Fransisco,Nice! But Not For Me,"This is a very nice vacuum, but not for me. I have several pets, so as you can imagine there is plenty of hair to go around. The vacuum is light weight which was great, but the suction wasn't sufficient enough to my liking as well as the battery life not lasting as advertised, so a bit disappointed on that front. I recommend for no kids, no pet households."
amazon,LG A939KBGS,1,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 16, 2022",Jack,LG make some fine products; this is not one of them.,"LG make some fine products; this is not one of them.The user manual is terrible. To me the instructions are out of order. The line drawings are not clear. And in general it’s just bad. I thought the worst user manuals were in the software domain but this, relative to the complexity of the product, beats even the bad SW manuals.The stand requires too much space because of space required for doors on either side to swing out.There is very little actual vacuum even in turbo mode; it relies on the brushes to pick stuff up but then it cannot pull the stuff into the dust canister. Very light stuff (I think it’s carpet fibers mixed with dust does not pass into the dust canister and then backs up in the pipe between the floor brush part and the motor/vacuum part. The stuff in the pipe is easily blow out with a slight puff (which partially shows how poor the suction of the product is) but the stuff stuck in the motor unit that can’t get into the dust canister is nearly impossible to remove and it has to be done after about three minutes of use.This is a totally impractical product. I don’t know how LG let it go to market nor how it remains on the market (it probably won’t after all the suckers like me get burned).I have a vacuum cleaner I bought for $35 on sale at Walmart to use in a small condominium in Colorado that works far better that this. Moving the power cord of the $35 product, or my Panasonic and Hoover units I use at home, from outlet to outlet is a lot easier and done less frequently than fooling with the nearly impossible jams of this cordless unit.This came in so many parts and with such a poor user manual that I let it sit for a long time before attempting to assemble and use it. The Amazon return date has passed so I might take it to a thrift store for a slight tax deduction but I really hate to think about someone else wasting even far less money than I have on this product. Although, for me, this is not a significant financial hit, I am still angry that I have wasted nearly $1K on this thing (I guess I should be angry mostly at myself for letting the return date pass but the poor user manual contributed to this).I strongly recommend you stay away from this product."
amazon,LG A939KBGS,5,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 26, 2023",Ryan,Just what I was looking for,"Bought this because we already had a lower model Cordzero and have been happy with it, but hate how messy and dirty it is to empty.  A key question I had was - can we empty our existing cordzero in the base station?  The answer is YES, which is huge.  Will update if we run into any reliability issues but so far very happy and no more fussing with getting the dirt out and sneezing all the while!"
amazon,LG A939KBGS,5,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 21, 2023",zoraida,Replaced my upright!,"My upright is too heavy for me to use and cleaning it out was another choir, this empty’s itself and lets you know when it’s time to change filters, also it empties itself every time you return to port."
amazon,LG A939KBGS,1,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 25, 2023",Jamie Sikora,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If I could give this ZERO stars, I would. The suction mechanism on this device is AWFUL. Wanna vacuum 4 pieces of sand and then 6 dog hairs? SORRY! YOU CAN'T! You have to repeatedly CLEAN OUT THE NOZZLE AFTER EVERY 2 SWIPES OF THE FLOOR.  The automatic cleaner doesn't empty the bin completely. Dirt falls out of the vacuum head when placing it back in the stand. Did you want to vacuum up that granule of laundry crystals? Here's how you can successfully get rid of the laundry crystal; after pushing it around with the vacuum head 67 times, pick the vacuum UP, and lay the head DIRECTLY on TOP of the crystal; when this doesn't work after 32 attempts, simply bend over and pick up the crystal with your HANDS then throw it in your garbage! Cinshy! We contacted LG about our issues and they asked us to return the vacuum. We waited 2 weeks to get the box. Another week to get the return label. It then took 3 weeks for them to ""repair"" the device and return it to us UNREPAIRED. SAME FREAKING ISSUES!!!!!!!!! If you like feeling rage and seeing red while vacuuming; if you enjoy having to tear apart and clean the suction nozzle on your vacuum every 5 seconds; if you enjoy slipping in your tears as you try to use this POS vacuum;  if you want to be borderline homicidal while trying to suck a piece of hair off your floor; if you love watching a thousand dollars go out the window, then this is the vacuum for you. Me, personally,  I hate it. It's awful. LG sucks. Their customer service sucks, too. Thanks for not just one, but TWO, crappy devices without suction. XOXO"
amazon,LG A939KBGS,5,"January 31, 2023",Amazon Customer,This stick vacuum outperforms every  high quality vacuum I've owned.,I love the fact that the docking station fully extracts all the dust and debris from the canister without direct handling. The attachments are intuitive and the cabinet that holds the attachments is sleek and attractive. The versatile attachments address areas of cleaning that other vacuums simply couldn't reach. It's quiet and lightweight. Very happy customer!
amazon,LG A939KBGS,2,"April 16, 2023",Rick Janson,"Impossible to keep it running, won't pick up tiniest of rocks","I clean it, I take it apart, I pull out all the filters and rinse/blow. This vacuum still can't pick up the tiniest of pebbles in our house, barely sucks in normal mode (always have to run in turbo) and lasts only half the house in boost suction mode. I had high hopes, terribly disappointed in how high maintenance and ineffective this product is."
amazon,LG A939KBGS,4,"August 6, 2022",Dan Nodsle,durable?,"My first time using the vacuum, I finished, put it in the charger and it worked fine.  I waited until the debris was sucked out of it.  I looked at the vacuum and the cover was still in the charger.  It had broken off.  So that was disappointing."

amazon,LG A939KBGS,5,"December 16, 2022",Yellzirg,Most convenient!,I think this is the best cordless machine made. Dyson...get with the program if you want to compete with this. The auto emptying is a must have if you're interested in keeping your room clean. I like Dyson's engineering up to now but WOW! Why didn't you think of this?
amazon,LG A939KBGS,1,"May 7, 2023",sonia grewal,Just the looks,The suction isn’t too good. All the previous vacuums I’ve owned have bristles that pick up from the sides. This one just pushes small debris out and takes several passes. Not very convenient as it requires multiple changes of attachments rather than one to do the job. I’ve had robo vacuums that do a better job than this one. The filter clogs up quick. Seems to require filter wash with every use. Not very convenient again. I bought this expensive $1200 vacuum because of not having to empty the canister but the clogged filter with each use and the smell because the unit is towards ur face at top of handle when vacuuming makes the job unpleasant. Over all waste of money. It doesn’t do a great job of its function: vacuum
amazon,LG A939KBGS,5,"August 12, 2022",Angela,Great Cordless Vacuum!,"This LG Cordzero auto empty has been amazing!  We recently installed laminate flooring all through the house and this does great cleaning up after 3 dogs and a teen.  It was super easy to set up and we all like to use it.  Emptying out the dust cup used to be my least favorite.  I always felt like I was dumping dust back into the house.  Also, the battery life is great! And with 2 batteries, I can always vacuum! This is perfect!"
amazon,LG A939KBGS,2,"March 8, 2023",john,No soft roll head. So disappointed.,It’s working good. But they don’t send the soft roll for the hard floor. It is a main issue. Why???? It should be included. Very disappointed and uncomfortable without it.
amazon,LG A939KBGS,5,"November 21, 2022",Karen A.,Does SUCK.,The 1st days of ownership were great.  Now after 40 ish days the unit metaphorically SUCKS as leaves as much dog hair as it picks up.  Turbo suction makes no differnce.  I would NOT waste money again on LG product.
amazon,LG A939KBGS,2,"January 21, 2023",Teresa P. Moser,Would not waste the money,Not what we were expecting. We have big dogs and wanted something we could sweep and mop the house that would be easy to grab. The suction of it did not work well on the sweeper and the mop just moved dirty water around in the floor. Definitely not worth the cost and does not work as well as advertised!
amazon,LG A939KBGS,2,"October 22, 2022",Ele,Returned defective,"I loved it until it malfunctioned.  I ran it across my kitchen floor and it picked up all the grass that my dogs bring in.  Lightweight and maneuverable I vacuumed my stairs and put it on the charging station.  Then it was stuck on the station.  Spent an hour trying to get it unhooked.  I saw that the back door on the barrel opens up to empty the dust and the internal metal filter had been sucked right out and was in the base preventing the back door from closing on the vacuum barrel.  Within 5 hours of delivery it was boxed up, stuck on the base for return.  Sad …… I really did love it."

 I purchased the A9 Cord Zero from Amazon, for our new home because we have tiled floors and because of the self clean feature and cordless ability. The vacuum stayed in the original box, unopened for about a month. I finally opened and assembled the unit and found it was a very nice looking vacuum. Two weeks later, the roller started hesitating to spin until it stopped spinning totally and the motor just hums. This vacuum should not cost this much and have such a poor build quality. LG is sending me box to return it for repairs, when they should be replacing it no questions asked. Did not return to Amazon because the 30 days expired while the vacuum was still in the box."
amazon,LG A939KBGS,1,"March 7, 2023",Deedle,WORST PURCHASE EVER,"If you are trying to pick up dust from your floors, I assume it would work okay, but any little bit of dog hair, forget about it. After I used it the very first time, I had to literally pick the dog hair out of it by hand. It gets stuck in the small compartment above the slide down lever. My house is not full of dog hair, it is very clean and I purchased this to clean the tile floors. It didn’t last through one cleaning. It clogged and it took me an hour to pick the hair out of the mechanism. Really bad design. They need to remove the slide down lever and ring so it doesn’t back up and clog. It sat in the box for a month before I used it so now I’m stuck with it. So frustrating. If you have a dog, don’t buy it."
amazon,LG A939KBGS,5,"August 30, 2022",MrB,"Expensive, but a superb vacuum system","Very expensive, but after using it for a week, I am convinced it is well worth the cost. Dual batteries are really helpful, suction is excellent, tools are good, and the auto empty feature is brilliant - it really is the icing on the cake. My Dyson has been recycled - inferior in all respects."
amazon,LG A939KBGS,5,"May 8, 2022",Dana,Game-Changer,I love love love this vacuum. Such a game changer. Suction is great. The tower holds all of the accessories. The self-emptying feature is a must with any other vacuum now. Paying extra for the tower was so worth it. I’ll never get another vacuum with a cord. The extra battery comes in handy.I read another review that it stopped working after 5-6 months? I’ll update my review if I have problems past or at that time.

Twice, the canister opened tossing the contents all over the place.  I can't seem to figure out what is wrong.  It plays the music when inserted correctly and I hear the suctioning but nothing.

Unpacked all the parts, but when I saw how small the dust cup that the vacuum empties into, I was very irritated. Obviously, the manufacturer does not own dogs, especially not Golden Retrievers. The dust cups are throwaways, which means I would have to change them every five minutes. Not a great idea. I would think they would have something like a waste basket in there."

You never have to empty the bin with this unit.  It also stores the extra accessories and extra battery.The stick has great suction and is pretty quiet for being a cordless stick vac.  It rolls around the floor smoothly.  It can pick up dog fur, crumbs and dust.  It won’t pick up anything that is taller than the vac as it has to be able to roll over it to get it.  I have a puppy so I am constantly picking up dog fur everywhere.

amazon,LG A939KBGS,3,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 14, 2022",Dave Edmiston,Not worth it,"I like stick vacuums, sort of. Some of them are pretty good, but none of them are as good as a regular corded vacuum. The problem with stick vacs is that their mechanisms are basically the same as a robot (Rooma) but on a stick instead of in a robot.I ended up with stick vacuums at three different residences this year (long story). This one should have been my favorite since it's the most high-end, but it wasn't the best vacuum of the three.The suction isn't great with this one, so it doesn't clean around the floorboards very well whether it's on the carpet or hard flooring. This means I had to do a lap around the house with a broom to clean the baseboards, which totally defeats the purpose of a vacuum.Let me back up for a minute to talk about the setup...I'm one of those guys who reads the instructions. I like documentation and I'm paranoid that I'm going to break something expensive, so I read the docs. But I met my match with this product. The amount of documentation was daunting. They could have made a move out of it, but it would have been a three part set of three trilogies like Star Wars. Yes, there was that much documentation. Too bad the docs didn't really provide that much insight.The docs for the mop attachment were pretty good. And that attachment was honestly pretty cool. What it didn't clarify very well though was that the water in the mop attachment was really just to wash away whatever product you applied to the floor. If you wanted the floor to shine, you had to squirt it with something like Mop & Glow first. Fair enough.I feel like I'm rambling a little bit. Sorry about that.One of the other things that bothered me was the cost of the consumables. I would have loved it if the self-emptying feature emptied the vac into something reusable, but it emptied into a special bag and the replacement bags were really hard to find. Last I checked, the bags weren't available on Amazon but I found them at a local vacuum shop for something like $30 for a 2-pack. Not interested. I quit looking after that and just emptied the vac into the trash by hand. It was easier and cheaper that way.The one thing they really got right though was the attachment storage. You just opened the doors on the tall base and there was a home for each of the attachments. Nice.So all in all, this vacuum looks pretty cool and it's easy enough to operate. My complaints are: an insane amount of disorganized documentation, expensive consumables, and middle of the road suction. And my praises are: a pretty decent wet mop solution, an attractive base (if you're into droids), and superior storage for the attachments.None of this adds up to nearly a thousand bucks worth of value to me."

amazon,LG A939KBGS,1,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 5, 2023",Gray_um,Zero stars!!,"The vacuum sucks and flat out is terrible. The base doesn’t function. It’s a terrible design that bottlenecks, clogs, and cannot empty the vacuum. The base even spills a little dirt every time you pick up the vacuum. LG fought me for months on a return. Worst customer experience of my life. They made me send in for a repair. After “repairing”, nothing improved.  After months of emails (because it takes 15+ transfers and hours to get an LG person on the phone, and they won’t help anyway and finally filing a PayPal dispute, they sent me a box and return label, AND IT WASNT EVEN A BIG ENOUGH BOX TO FIT THE PRODUCT."
amazon,LG A939KBGS,5,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 22, 2022",Roni,This one certainly sucks.... in a good way,"This vacuum is amazing with a lot of great features. When you first open the box, the vacuum and attachments are in three boxes. The initial set-up of the vacuum is fairly easy once you open everything. The base for the vacuum is very simple and modern. The vacuum sits nicely in the middle with auto charging, the sides are actually doors where you can store the attachments, the bag is on the inside of the base, and the extra battery charges on top. I love that I can store everything and not have to see it all. The package comes with the vacuum itself, the base, two batteries, a general vacuum attachment, pet hair attachment, mopping attachment, two smaller attachments, a spare battery, 4 microfiber mop clothes, two reusable filters, and two bags.In my apartment, I have rugs and laminate floors. I had no issues with using the general vacuum attachment to clean everything. The suction is great, but you are able to increase the suction to turbo. The turbo works great for hair or extra dirt, but it does drain the battery quite a bit more. I recently had a friend with a dog visit and was excited to test out the pet hair attachment. It’s significantly smaller so if you have a large space, it may take longer to clean. I think it did a great job getting all of the hair out of my rugs. If you have a pet that is a heavy shedder, this may not be for you but mild-moderate shedding would be fine. They have a soft attachment that I used for corners, baseboards, window sills and it was perfect for cleaning up some dust.I was very excited about the mopping attachment. I think it’s a wonderful feature with some limitations. Directions say to only use water, so you can’t use any floor cleaner. You are suppose to wet the pads before starting, which is definitely necessary! The mop attachment has a water reservoir and three levels to dispense water: no water, low water, or high water. It certainly dispenses a lot less than I expected. I’ve kept it on high water and by the time I clean my kitchen floors, I couldn’t even tell the water tank was empty. I think this is a great feature for just regular maintenance of floors, but if you need to really clean them, may need to use a regular mop. The microfiber clothes are soft on the floor and the vacuum does a great job rotating them while cleaning. Safe to use on my laminate floor.LG has produced a package of additional attachments to use with this vacuum, including a mattress attachment. I use the pet hair attachment on my mattress recently and worked fine! But it’s nice to know there are extra attachments to purchase.The biggest highlight of the system is the automatic dispensing. There’s nothing I hate more than emptying a vacuum and getting dust and hair everywhere. Once you bring the vacuum back to the base, it automatically charges and automatically cleans out the debris in the vacuum and dumps it into the bag. The system alerts you when the bag is ready to be changed. It does such a wonderful job at getting everything out of the vacuum! It is a bit loud when it does this, but it doesn’t take long.Overall, I highly recommend this vacuum! It’s sleek, lightweight, easy to use, and keeps everything clean. There’s always limitations to cordless vacuums, but overall this vacuum does an excellent job. I’m very satisfied and looking forward to cleaning with it!"
amazon,LG A939KBGS,3,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 7, 2022",Finch,"Expensive, convenient, could use some improvement","I like this vacuum. I don't love this vacuum. And at this price point, I really should love it.Lot's of other reviews cover some great features, so I'm going to stick mostly to what I think needs improvement.CONS1) the regular roller attachment does not pick up on smooth surfaces well at all. I have my cat bowls in the kitchen and they often end up with cat food around them. When I'm vacuuming I take this to the kitchen to try to get all the bits of cat food, it seriously won't pick up any of the cat food on my floor. Something about the smooth floor and the largish object, it just won't. It pushes it around and that's very silly for a vacuum so expensive.2) I do love that they tried with the mop attachment but without heat I think it's kind of meh. I know it would probably be impossible to make it heated. The mopping experience is very lackluster. If you have anything stuck on your floor it takes a very long time for it to get it up. It's okay for a quick rinse but not a big cleaning.3) The weighting of this vacuum is a tad awkward. We have another similar style vacuum and the balance is much better. This one might be uncomfortable for folks who are less stable on their feet or aren't as strong (children, elderly, other mobility considerations).PROSThis is not an all inclusive list, there are many good things about it.1) the extendable wand is slightly longer than a very similar vacuum like this that we have. That makes it more comfortable for my partner to whole who is taller than me.2) Accessory storage. I think the actual stand is pretty ugly. But the fact that all the accessories store inside is pretty great.3) Suction on carpet is pretty good. Like I said, a bit dicey on harder floors for some reason but overall suction is pretty good (not amazing but pretty good)."

amazon,LG A939KBGS,3,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 17, 2022",Jesse Baynard,"I love it, but it the mop is a huge disappointment","UPDATE: After a couple of months of use, this is my favorite vacuum to reach for and use. It's so convenient and easy to use. I finally filled my first bag and it was super easy to change and packed full of dust and debris that are no longer in my home... and not once did I have to shake debris out over an open trash can like other stick vacs. I still think they should've skipped including the mop but I found a small use for it when I had some construction dust on the floors. But as a quality of life changing simple yet powerful vacuum that doesn't make me constantly clean the cleaner I would rate this as 5 stars and very much worth the money.--------- ORIGINAL REVIEW --------Overall, if you are wanting a great stick vacuum (as long it's running on medium or high power), without all the dirty work of emptying out the dirt cup and money is no object then this is a great vacuum and I'd give at least 4.5 stars (I really wish it balanced better and you will eventually have to deep clean parts). But if you were considering a steam vac and hoping that this would do all... amazing vacuuming, storage, self cleaning AND also mop/sanitize your floors... forget about it. This is at best a damp mop without any real cleaning power. If you want this because of the mop feature I'd have to give it a low 3, it's not worth it and you really should consider that steam vacuum. It'd be nice if they offered this model without the mop attachment at a lower price.PROS:+ It's light and easy to use for vacuuming, one power button tap is all it takes to get it running+ Of the 3 levels of suction, the middle one is good and the top gear is very impressive. It will pull dirt in from a distance, much more than any other cordless vacuum (and even many corded ones).+ The self emptying feature removes the biggest common hassle among most stick vacuums. It's easy to use too, just drop it on and it takes care of the rest.+ The storage caddy has a place for everything (other than spare bags and pads)+ The spare charged battery means you never get caught with a dead battery mid clean.+ The debris compression lever is brilliant... It lets you run longer and solves the old hair wrapped around the filter problem common with other stick vacuums.NEUTRAL:* The Wifi feature is neat, I can see its charging status, care instructions, run a diagnosis and see the cleaning history all from the app. But none of that is terrible necessary.* The base, while great, does require you to dedicate a fairly significant amount of floor space, beyond it's square foot you need room on the sides for the large attachments to hang from and for the doors to open to get to the smaller accessories and the vacuum bag. You also need some space in the back for it to vent.* All stick vacuums seam to be guilty of it, but why so they provide such a worthless low power mode? I'm sure it's so they can advertise a 2 hour run time or some such nonsense... But it barely picks up large debris and when you turn it off it just falls back down the tube. Maybe for dusting delicate items? I'd much prefer the two useful power levels, one that's good enough for a several of decent sized rooms and another that will suck up killer dust bunnies.CONS:- The mop attachment is a joke. I'm not sure what the point of it is. It spins a rag that's a little damp? If you need to really clean hard floors, get a steam mop. For half the price you can get a killer vacuum and mop combination that really cleans and sanitizes the floor. This one does not get hot, does not allow detergents to be used, does not suction at the dirty water/grime, and barely has any scrubbing power. Maybe mine is defective, but it does light up and spin around?- It doesn't self stand or balance very well. I know a lot of premium stick mops don't but do they have to make them so awkward and top heavy that they are awkward to lean against a wall or chair for a short while? You could drop it back on its base, but that will start the self cleaning cycle and lock it into place for a couple minutes.- The manual makes several mentions of non replaceable filters or parts that will eventually need customer service to fix. In the base station in particular. This feels like an ominous time bomb waiting to put your expensive vacuum out of commission. Is it months, year or decades? No clue, but hopefully later rather than sooner."

 The LG engineers thought of almost everything with this one, except one. After replacing my Dyson V8 with a Samsung Bespoke, I got this vacuum, so those two are my comparison points. So here are my impressions are using it for a couple months:🧼 Vacuum power's comparable to the other two. I wouldn't say it's better regarding my previous two vacuums, and that's fine.🧼 The base is one of the most thoughtfully designed of the range of smart vacuums I looked at. It re-locks the dust collection chamber, which Samsung doesn't. It charges the spare battery, while the Samsung requires a separate dock, and the Dyson just doesn't come with it. It houses all its attachments inside of it. It's just really well thought out.🧼 There are two exceptions to the praise above. The wet mop's spare pads don't have a storage area in the base nor its pouring cup. The extension tube's end also tends to collect microfine particles due to static, and when you mount the vacuum, it falls out and sits on the base. That's probably my biggest complaint.🧼 It also has wifi capability to track usage, which is a bit silly but works well. It even tracks which suction strength you used.It's incredibly pricy but very feature-rich for a stick vacuum. It's both attractively designed and thoughtfully implemented. If you're on the fence because of its price tag, I'd say it's worth it."

From elegant design to function, this is the high-end vacuum with a base station that is worth it, especially if you don’t have a nice vacuum at the moment and you’ve been waiting too long to get one.LG is better at vacuum design than Samsung. I’ve had the opportunity to compare this vacuum to the Samsung alternative that too has automatic emptying. First, the CordZero has a double battery, which means you can use it longer than the Samsung. This is huge when it comes to cordless vacuums!Another advantage with LG is simply the ergonomics of the design. Samsung makes a round base that feels bulky and like it doesn’t belong wherever I try to place it. The LG CordZero base on the other hand feels right at home against a wall or in a corner.Just make sure you have a place in mind for the base before you order!"

The auto empty system is bagged NOT bag-less. Meaning you have to purchase additional bags to use the auto empty function. Never used this feature because of this.

If you have hard floors, good luck. Anything thicker than a hair will not be picked up. There is a microscopic opening in which things can actually be vacuumed up between the head and the floor. Non adjustable either.

That's easy to do, it just pops open and dumps into your trash. This is *not* a good unit for picking up large debris on the floor. 

This vacuum/mopping system has replaced several cleaning tools. Our big vacuum, my little ""car vacuum"" and our damp mop. I vacuum the house, we used a robot vac for a few years, it took too long to straighten up for its use to make it a labor-saving device. I can vacuum with this and it does as good a job as the robot and I spend hardly more effort. 

It cleans rugs well, it's a bit of a clickity-clackity on tile, but it also vacuums it well. 

The width and height of the head allow me to get under almost everything in our house. 

I was initially amazed at how much dust, hair, and dirt the robot vac got up off of our seemingly clean floors. This vacuum does the same thing, perhaps a little more. So I know it's doing a good job. 

Only once thus far have I used it long enough to run out of battery power and have to swap batteries. So it's got a pretty long runtime. We have a 2400 sq/ft house. Tile, bamboo, and carpet. 

This fits into a really small corner of our house. Those are standard vertical blinds in the picture. 

It gets a 4/5 for less than stellar suction and large particle cleanup."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,4,"May 26, 2022 1:07 PM",Mukman,Nice Multi Use Vacuum,"Set up and instructions were easy to follow.

LG even supplies 2 quick access cards with all the assembly and maintenance items needed. Well formatted and written.

You also can download an app called LG ThinQ to your phone. This is a smart home app for all things LG.  It allows you to see the usage of the vacuum, charge status, run diagnostic and shop at LG store. (As of the writing of this review, I could not find the filter bags at the LG store)

As quick overview, below are my pros and cons.

Pros:
•	Good Suction levels
•	Rolls Nice – Head stays down
•	Good battery life when in default mode
•	NO CORD
•	Self-Cleaning
•	Light weight
•	Extra battery with onboard charging
•	Hidden tool storage
•	Easy extend/disconnect buttons
•	On/off Power button

Cons:
•	Only 9” wide brush
•	Filter bag cost
•	Mop head unit disappointing
•	Would like larger collection bag or canister (People with pets)
•	Will push around larger items like cereal/pretzels on hardwood floors

Overall, I really like this, LG CordZero. It does the job well for what is designed for. The Self-cleaning tower is probably the most impressive feature.

 
As mentioned above (in Cons) the only small tweaks I would prefer is to make the head a little larger to cover more area at a time. The small size does have the advantage of getting between items like chairs though.


 I would also like to see either larger holding bag in the self-cleaning unit, or a canister you could just dump out. 
We have two dogs that shed, so the cleaning bag located in the self-cleaning stand will fill up quickly. 
I have used this about 10 times and the bag is almost full.
This will result in an added expense, so I do wish this bag was larger, or less cost for replacements. I found the bags online at $19.99 for a pack of three. (Thee came with the unit). If you have no animals, this will not be a problem for you.


Experience with cleaning: 

The stick itself is easy to extend with the push of a button. Much easier than other units I have tested.
You can easily add the accessory pieces to reach into ceiling corners etc. I did use the brush accessory to clean our ceiling fan grills and found that I had to use the turbo mode to prevent the dust from just falling on my head. All other vacuuming, I have used the default mode and it seemed to clean well.


What my wife noticed early on is that this unit will clean the light bathroom rugs without sucking them into the head unit like others do. Best vacuum so far at this task.


My experience with cleaning hardwood floors is that if you have normal dirt, it cleaned fine. If you had a larger piece of dried food, such as broken pretzel or a piece of cereal, the head unit would just push it around. If you need to pick those items up, I found if I simply picked up the head and pulled backwards over the debris, it picked up fine. I did use the Power mode for more suction.


Carpet cleaning worked well in normal mode.


The power and function switches are located on the top. No need to hold the button down to clean like some other units. You can hit the plus button for more suction and minus for less. If you hold the plus button down for three seconds you get into turbo mode. This has incredible suction but will drain your battery quickly.

Battery Max run time as indicated on the supplied card:
Using nozzle:
Turbo Mode – 6  Minutes
Power Mode – 20 Minutes
Normal Mode – 40 Minutes

Using a tool:
Turbo Mode – 7  Minutes
Power Mode – 30 Minutes
Normal Mode – 60 Minutes


The self-cleaning tower unit has a clean look, stores all your tools, and does a great job emptying the canister. It stands 40” tall and need to plug into the wall outlet. It stores all accessories and holds and charges the spare battery and the vacuum.

Every time you store the vacuum, you need to retract the stick and place into the base. Automatically the unit will empty the canister. This is a little loud but only last about 30 seconds. You can press the start/stop button on the top of the tower to bypass this if you like.


The Kompressor slider is nice feature. It allows you to compact the dirt in the canister using a simple slider lever, allowing more use between having to empty. Also allows you to discharge dirt when manually emptying the canister. Other units I have tested lack this feature and forces you to use a tool or your fingers to get all the dirt out. Nice job LG.

Speaking of tools, LG does include a small brush to clean out the canister when doing maintenance.

Filters appear easy to maintain and do an awesome job filtering out the dust and allergen particles.



Mop Head feature:

We did not find this super useful. It does an okay job laying water down on the floor to maybe remove something items the vacuum could not, but if has no option to spot treat with a little extra water like some mop units. The head has three water dispensing settings, Off, Low & High.
You are instructed to only fill the reservoir with water. We may try spraying some floor cleaner down first to see if we get better results. 
You must go slow when cleaning as well. After we cleaned the kitchen floor, we then ran a swiffer over the area and found it picked up quite a bit of dirt. So not sure this mop head will be used much for us.

So, final thoughts. I would say for a house mostly with carpet or hard floors with standard debris, this is a nice unit. The self-empty feature is fantastic.

If you have mostly hardwood, with kids that drop cereal or such larger (Pea size of large) items on the floor that you would like to pick up with the vacuum, there might be better choices such as vacuums with front soft roller, or other method to pick up larger items.
If you have mostly carpet and want a universal vacuum that can do your daily tasks, has a tower that can not only store and charge the vacuum but can also self-empty and hold all the accessories PLUS another battery. Then you might consider this LG CordZero All in One Auto Empty.
If the auto empty is not a feature you need, LG does offer other options for less cost.

Warranty – 1 year parts and labor, but 10 year on the Inverter motor.

bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,3,"Dec 28, 2022 9:47 PM",Rissarella,"Good, but not great.","I love the ease of the self emptying compressor. Very lightweight.
Downside is that it gets clogged very easily and doesn't have the best suction. I also still can't figure out the mop portion, which is the main reason I chose this model.
For the price tag, I expect it to perform better. I wish I would have saved my money and purchased something else."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,"May 30, 2022 11:29 PM",underdog217,This certainly doesn’t suck,"This vacuum is amazing with a lot of great features. When you first open the box, the vacuum and attachments are in three boxes. The initial set-up of the vacuum is fairly easy once you open everything. The base for the vacuum is very simple and modern. The vacuum sits nicely in the middle with auto charging, the sides are actually doors where you can store the attachments, the bag is on the inside of the base, and the extra battery charges on top. I love that I can store everything and not have to see it all. The package comes with the vacuum itself, the base, two batteries, a general vacuum attachment, pet hair attachment, mopping attachment, two smaller attachments, a spare battery, 4 microfiber mop clothes, two reusable filters, and two bags.

In my apartment, I have rugs and laminate floors. I had no issues with using the general vacuum attachment to clean everything. The suction is great, but you are able to increase the suction to turbo. The turbo works great for hair or extra dirt, but it does drain the battery quite a bit more. I recently had a friend with a dog visit and was excited to test out the pet hair attachment. It’s significantly smaller so if you have a large space, it may take longer to clean. I think it did a great job getting all of the hair out of my rugs. If you have a pet that is a heavy shedder, this may not be for you but mild-moderate shedding would be fine. They have a soft attachment that I used for corners, baseboards, window sills and it was perfect for cleaning up some dust.  

I was very excited about the mopping attachment. I think it’s a wonderful feature with some limitations. Directions say to only use water, so you can’t use any floor cleaner. You are suppose to wet the pads before starting, which is definitely necessary! The mop attachment has a water reservoir and three levels to dispense water: no water, low water, or high water. It certainly dispenses a lot less than I expected. I’ve kept it on high water and by the time I clean my kitchen floors, I couldn’t even tell the water tank was empty. I think this is a great feature for just regular maintenance of floors, but if you need to really clean them, may need to use a regular mop. The microfiber clothes are soft on the floor and the vacuum does a great job rotating them while cleaning. Safe to use on my laminate floor.

LG has produced a package of additional attachments to use with this vacuum, including a mattress attachment. I use the pet hair attachment on my mattress recently and worked fine! But it’s nice to know there are extra attachments to purchase. 

The biggest highlight of the system is the automatic dispensing. There’s nothing I hate more than emptying a vacuum and getting dust and hair everywhere. Once you bring the vacuum back to the base, it automatically charges and automatically cleans out the debris in the vacuum and dumps it into the bag. The system alerts you when the bag is ready to be changed. It does such a wonderful job at getting everything out of the vacuum! It is a bit loud when it does this, but it doesn’t take long. 

Overall, I highly recommend this vacuum! It’s sleek, lightweight, easy to use, and keeps everything clean. There’s always limitations to cordless vacuums, but overall this vacuum does an excellent job. I’m very satisfied and looking forward to cleaning with it!!"
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,3,"May 19, 2022 3:04 PM",bamfsig45,"Light weight, easy to use. Not the best suction.","The box this comes in is large, everything is packed nice and neat. Setup is pretty straight forward. But reading the guide might help some people.  The included attachments are the Power Mop for your kitchen or bathroom and hard surfaces. The crevice tool, a 2n1 combination tool, the telescopic wand and the Universal Power Nozzle, and two replacement vacuum bags for the base. All the attachments have a storage spot inside the two doors that open on either side of the main base station. Together this has everything you would need for keeping things clean.

Also has two rechargeable batteries with the following usage times.  Normal: 120min, Power: 60min, Turbo: 14min. Normal: 80min, Power: 40min, Turbo: 12min.  The batteries charge in the base/charging tower which is highly convenient.  One stays on the stick vacuum to charge and the other goes into the top compartment for charging.  

Onto the real world usage that I've done.  First I did not download the LG ThinQ app that is supposed to tell you things like cleaning patterns and errors ect.  Second the batteries come drained which will require charging before use.  I let them charge overnight.  Also, I have not used the power mop yet as of this review.  But plan too soon.  Its a vacuum first IMO.

I have a German Shepherd and if you know the breed, well they shed like crazy. So a good vacuum with lots of power is a necessity.  When first turning the stick vacuum on its in Normal mode. I could tell immediately that it wasn't going to be powerful enough for the job ahead. I quickly placed the vacuum on Turbo mode and it worked a lot better.  Still not perfect, but better than the default normal setting.  After 5 minutes of vacuuming I got a clog, the vacuum errored out and turned off.  I had to remove the attachments and pull out the hair from the top of the wand where it connects to the main unit, next to the canister. It appeared as though there was something large blocking the airway. Nope just dog hair.  After clearing the clog I went back to vacuuming and never had a clogging issue again (two days straight now).  Even the auto empty feature of the base would not unclogged the vacuum, just so you know.  But, as long as everything is in the canister then the auto emptying feature works very well.  You have to get the stick vacuum just right in the base for the Auto empty feature to work. Took me a couple times to get it right.

I did use this vacuum without the Power Nozzle for some spot cleaning and that worked ok.  It was just more dog hair along the edges of the rooms and the corners. Nothing big like spilt cereal or other food items. I feel it might struggle.

I feel the price for what you get, is a little high.  It just doesn't seem to have the power of my full size vacuum. And maybe it wasn't meant to replace that. But for the price you would think it would.  I will continue to use it full time though before I make up my mind fully.  Maybe if I didn't have a dog that sheds so much this would be a better fit.

I think for apartment dwellers and people without dogs (or at least shedding dogs) this would be a better fit.  Its hard to recommend this vacuum.  Another last minute note.  The vacuum bags are 19.00 a piece and according to the LG website the bags will hold 3 Kompressed loads of dirt before needing replaced. That's going to get expensive if you ask me.  I bet I find myself emptying the bags and re-using them. If that's even a possibility."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,"May 19, 2022 5:04 PM",Zaid,"All-In-One Vacuum, storage, charge, and mop","During the last decade and companies are working on designing vacuums that are lightweight, cordless, easy to navigate, and emptying canisters. Usually, we have several options out there in the market to choose from but none of them truly offers what I exactly need. besides to aforementioned specs, self-emptying is becoming a demand. Personally, I would prefer to buy vacuums with such a feature only because of time constraints that lead me to invest in robot vacuums even though they are not as powerful as the regular human-operated ones. I believe and after my experience with this LG CordZero, I found that this LG provides me with a lot of conveniences; it is an all-in-one vacuuming solution, lightweight, and truly cordless since the tower serves as a storage, charger, and self-emptying whenever the vacuum is docked. it has powerful suction and looks modern and stylish. 

The LG tower has two doors that serve as storage areas to store different attachments in each door compartment. In addition, The tower top is accessible it has a lid that can open up, and inside that small compartment, there is a charging station as well as a storage area for the second battery located underneath the top lid of the tower. This means there is always a spare charged battery that is always ready to use if needed. This top lid is a touch display where all touch control buttons are located such as auto mode, battery life, and dust emptying. Auto mode activates the self-emptying every time the vacuum sits back on the tower. By turning off the auto mode, self-emptying can be activated manually. The middle area when both doors are open is the house of the dust bag. I like the vacuum telescopic wand, it is adjustable and sturdy and easy to use and maneuver to reach low and high places but it does not have headlights which is a drawback to me. 

The power mop feature is my other drawback, according to the manual it is not allowed to use any cleaning solution except water also the pads can be hand-washed only. From my experience, such limitation tells me that the power mop feature is marginal and not meant to be a replacement for the regular powered mop. It is still a nice touch to have for quick mopping but it is that efficient. The bin kompressor is a smart feature that doubles the storage of the tank which is a nice perk and I like it. It has a sliding handle that pushes and compacts debris to have more room for a longer vacuuming run. But what stands out about this stick vacuum is the self-emptying feature, it is convenient and provides a month of peace of mind and hassle-free bin emptying as well as the spare charged battery, and of course, the tower design in which all the attachments are stored, organized, and accessible.   

What is included in this all-in-one vacuum: Stick vacuum, power brush nozzle, telescopic wand, power mini brush, Power mop nozzle, Base plate with 4 self-adhesive pads, 4 washable mop pads, 3 dust bags, 2 batteries, and water cup, cleaning brush, and a combination and crevice tool."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,"May 17, 2022 7:13 PM",RalphHenry,Powerful Vacuum That Empties Itself,"I was very impressed with the functionality of this vacuum system. There are two parts, the cordless stick vacuum and the power base. The vacuum proved to be very powerful in cleaning about 1200 square feet of carpet on the turbo setting and still had plenty of charge left. This system came with two batteries. It is important to state one battery charges in the base power unit (to be ready when needed) and the other battery will also charge when the stick vacuum is docked on the base unit. Very smart design point. These 26 volt batteries provide a lot more suction power than the usual 14 to 18 volt systems; and proved long lasting as well.
After vacuuming 1200 square feet I noticed that the dust bin on the stick vacuum had about 3 inches of hair and dust particles. I had just used another cordless stick vacuum the day before for the same area. So this test definitely showed the LG vacuum power was far superior. 
The power base unit has its own vacuum setup to suck out the stick vac’s dustbin into a dust bag housed in the power base unit. I can confirm that the 3 inches of pet hair and dust was removed into the base unit (see my before and after photos). When I looked at the stick vac’s dust bin, not only was all the debris gone but it appeared the inside of the dust bin had been wiped clean – great system and a tip of the cap to the LG engineering team. You will notice that when the base unit cleans the stick vacuum dust bin, it actually opens the bottom plate on the dustbin and closes it again when the cycle is completed – I love that kind of engineering. The whole system has solid quality and is very well designed.
The system included a very complete set of accessories that included a small cleaning brush which was very handy for cleaning filters, a crevice tool, a combo brush and suction head that was great for cleaning car floors, a vacuum head with moving roller-brush for carpet, a mop head (2 spinning disc-shaped mops with liquid chamber) and a pet nozzle for furniture and other areas. Wow, a lot of uses covered. All these accessories store in the power base unit.
If all these features aren’t enough, the unit connects to your home’s WiFi system. Now using your cell-phone you can monitor activity of this vacuum system. I initially thought the WiFi control button was on the base unit, but it is on the stick vacuum and is labelled. The unit easily connected to the WiFi – you must use a 2.4 GHz access point.
I did also run the included mop head to clean my kitchen and bathroom floors. Easy job but be sure to wash the mop heads by hand after each use. It’s easier to dry the mop heads in a dryer but don’t put the heads in a washing machine.
The technology used in this vacuum system is outstanding. I highly recommend this vacuum system."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,"May 26, 2022 10:32 AM",2leo2,"Sweet, Light, Quiet, and Smooth","The LG vacuum is great, lightweight and cleans not only hard floor and carpet, but also itself. The battery lasts about 1.5 hours, which should be enough to clean the It comes with a second battery that can be charged while the primary battery is being used. The charging dock however has a place to store and charge both batteries at the same time if needed.  All accessories have storage space in the base, so you don't have to find a place for them. Has awesome wifi features to detect cleaning efficiency.

The mop attachment is not better than a steam mop but it does the job. The motor is quiet and mobility is smooth and effortless when pushing along the floor. I love the self cleaning feature, saves me time from cleaning out the vacuum myself. It does get loud during this process but it only lasts around 20 seconds. I had to clean out the canister that the waste goes in every 4 full uses, which isn't that often. Assembly is easy, just came in 5 pieces.

Overall, the vacuum is a well needed product and  conveniently packaged in a way to prevent major maintenance."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,3,"May 23, 2022 7:24 PM",mdh4pennstate,Good not Great and Expensive Cordless Vacuum / Mop,"With my review of this LG - CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum with Auto Empty and Kompressor, I give it 3 out of 5 stars.  Upon opening the three boxes, I located the instruction manuals.  Be prepared to dedicate some time to learn how to operate this product because it is not a function of plug and play!  It does take some time to put together, time to learn how to use, and finally, how to maintain.  The entire product takes up some floor real estate, measuring 40"" high, 14"" deep, and 18"" wide with depth and width measurements made with the two doors in the open position.

As for using the vacuum, I cleaned my entire home using the Universal Nozzle, covering luxury vinyl tile and carpet for a total run time of 29-minutes in Normal Mode to a fully exhausted battery.  Luckily there are two batteries with this product with the second battery in the charging station.  I have attached two pictures showing the amount of debris before and after using the Kompressor Lever.  As you can see from the debris, I have two cats that shed a LOT.  I then connected the vacuum back into the charging station and selected the Empty Dust mode.  I have attached a picture showing empty canister along with a picture of the Dust Bag, being approximately 3/4 full.

As for using the Mop Nozzle, you can only fill the mop reservoir with plain tap water with no cleaning agents at all.  There is a supplied water funnel that fills the reservoir with 200ml of water.  The Mop Nozzle is not intended to clean spills and only having the use of only water in the reservoir, I questioned how can this effectively clean floors.  For a test, I cleaned half my kitchen floor and much to my dismay, it didn’t look clean.  Perhaps my floor was too dirty so I found myself spraying a fine mist of tile floor cleaner and then going over with the Mop Nozzle.  If you had to clean a large area, I believe you would have to manually wash the mop heads, to avoid just spreading dirt around.

So in review of the price of $999 versus performance, I find this product not a great buy, hence 3 out of 5 star rating.  Here are some of the shortcomings I find in the design and function.  The vacuum Universal Nozzle does not have a lighted head making for cleaning in dark area or under beds cumbersome.  The size of the Dust Bag leads me to question its longevity before replacement as having mine ¾ filled with one use.  There isn’t a hard floor attachment for the vacuum and would not use the supplied beater-brush heads to clean delicate laminate flooring.  As for the Mop Nozzle, I find this for general light cleaning only along with the inability to use only water in the reservoir.  Finally as for attachments, there is the mention of some very useful attachments that such as Slim Hard Floor Nozzle, Flexible Hose Extension and its Crevice Tool, and Mattress Tool, as part of their Total Care Kit but they are free only if purchased directly through LG.com.  I hope you enjoyed my review of this product and it helps you in your purchase decision."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,3,"May 24, 2022 7:52 PM",doop22,It's good but there are better options out there,"I received the LG CordZero Stick Vacuum with high expectations, and after using it for about a week, I was meh about it. 

It comes loaded to the 9s with attachments and spare parts, like washable and reusable filters, a spare battery. What I was not expecting was a mop attachment to clean up small spills.

Set up was simple, just find the parts and build the vacuum like a very expensive Lego set. The canister stand is pretty straight forward, just plug it in to the outlet. It does open up like an armoire revealing compartments for the attachments, you're most likely to use often. The top of the stand flips up, revealing a spot to charge the spare battery. Even the waste bin and filter were already installed and ready to go. With the auto empty feature or it being turned on at all, does lock the vacuum in to the dock so it can't be removed while emptying. It even plays a little song while doing so. 

There is an app that I was told to use while reviewing the CordZero, but it was absolutely useless as it doesn't do much for the function of the vacuum. The most I believe you would use it for would be to reorder replacement filters or something. I wasn't able to register it for warranty as I didn't actually purchase this unit, so there's that unless I didn't something wrong on my end.

In use it's an extremely capable vacuum, it cleans really deep in turbo mode, pretty lightweight and emptying it is super convenient with the Auto Empty feature but can be emptied as any other $90 canister stick vacuum would be able to by just dumping the canister into the trash."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,2,"May 27, 2022 9:09 PM",Magneto,Could be better on carpets,"This is a very expensive product and I cannot give it more than two stars. The base had a crack in it when the product arrived and it is something that I did not expect from a 1000 dollar product. Extra headache consumes time and I hope this was just a one--off incident.

It took me around 20 minutes to get the parts out of the boxes, read the directions (two separate booklets: one for the vacuum and one for the charging station. It took me around 30 seconds to put everything together. Unfortunately, the base of the charging station came broken in the box. The charging station has a smart bento box-like design where the parts can be inserted when not in use. There are three different insets for dry vacuum (regular), mopping, and narrower head to reach into corners. The last one is great for staircases, between car seats, and floor corners. The set up looks nifty and cute The battery charger works fast, battery life is good, self-cleaning mechanism of the dust works fine.

While the good looking, moderately heavy, good picker-up-er works well for lighter cleaning on hardwood floor, it could not handle my pet’s fur on carpet. The machine got stuck every few minutes and I had to open the top nozzle and clean out the rod with disposable chop sticks. My kids love crafting and carpeted floor in their room is always full of bits of paper. The bits of paper and the dog fur worked together and chocked the pipe after every two minutes. I will probably use this on hardwood floors, the car, and stairs only.

The function of the wi-fi is unclear to me and I am not sure if I will ever need to use the wifi. The placement of the turbo and wi-fi switches are a problem. It should probably be above the on/off switch instead of below. Or may be on the sides. While vacuuming, my hand kept hitting the turbo and that was a little annoying. Because of its top-heavy design, the vacuum cannot be kept anywhere in upright position except for the charging station. If you lean it on the wall, it will slide down because of the heaviness of the motor. 

This small expensive fancy thing is good for light clean ups but unsuitable for carpeted floors in with furries and messy kids, which is a big disappointment at this price-point."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,"May 25, 2022 9:43 AM",Idoc,Compact rechargeable self emptying vacuum,"I found the LG CordZero All in One to be quite capable.  It cleans hardwood and tile easily.  Using the mop head to clean was a breeze on our hardwood and kitchen flooring. The battery life was good using only 1 bar after vacuuming the whole house.  I like how lightweight it is and makes cleaning the stairs fast and easy.  It struggles just a bit on low pile rugs, but was able to do the job. A pile adjustment would be a welcome addition. The turbo switch offers more suction when needed. The ability to use the vaccine without the stick extention is great for upholstry and automotive vacuuming. 
As for looks the charging stand will be at home in any modern decor. The stand itself is clean looking and compact. The vacuum automatically empties it's contents and charges when it is docked. The stand hold the vacuum with the stick extension and vacuum head without disassembly. The accessories are stored neatly on the right side hidden from sight under the side door.

bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,"May 19, 2022 7:38 PM",aved0n,Extraordinary and Beautiful,"If i could rate the LG CordZero™ All in One Auto Empty Cordless Stick Vacuum with higher than 5 stars i would do so, gladly.

First lets go over 2 terms that make this vacuum as incredible as it is.

KOMPRESSOR technology means that the dirt and dust is compressed in the waste receptacle thus meaning you have to dump less while vacuuming.

INVERTER technology means that the motor (which boasts a 10 year warranty by LG) operates at less than high speed without sacrificing suction power.

Impressed yet? Stick around it only gets better. A lot of products boast rhat they are a complete system leaving out that for their system to be complete ya have to shell out some more cash.

Not LG!!! Unboxing the LG CordZero™ All in One Auto Empty Cordless Stick Vacuum i found out quickly that this is an All in One system and came with everything needed to handle your vacuuming duties. Unboxing i said to myself, ahh ok but i'll bet it doesnt include XY or Z. It did, right down to extra waste bags.

The hard surface polisher / cleaner was most impressive with its stainless steel cleaning heads to the high quality housing. This isnt some entry level item but a real deal built to last tool.

Speaking of accessories the LG CordZero™ All in One Auto Empty Cordless Stick Vacuum comes with all the usual suspects (attachments), of course all high quality.

Now for the best part. We have all bought vacuumes that have a plethora of attachments that ya have to wonder, where the heck ro i store all of this. Honestly as in my case with the exception of 1 or 2 i wind up misplacing them.

This is why this is unique LG has built in storage foe eveything so it all stays in the base unit and is hidden from view. So Cool!!!

The LG CordZero™ All in One Auto Empty Cordless Stick Vacuum is light as a feather but a powerhouse for cleaning. It jandles pet hair and allergens with ease and with Kompressor tech the dirt is compressed for less stop and go time.

This baby comes with a second battery to give approximately just under 2 hours of cleaning time. Your time may vary. The wand extends so even a 12 year old can vacuum. Ha! Good luck with that though.

The base is a charger for both batteries, holder for accessories and auto recepticle for your debris. This elimintes the spillage of manually dumping the dirt.  Lets be honest, this thing is powerful and attractive. The app tells ya when its time to change bags and can order for you, if you like.

I cant say enough about this unit and I am sure you will agree too.

I have 3 cats, 2 rooms with carpet and lots of furniture so a great vacuum is a must for me.  I need to be great at 3 things: picking up cat hair from carpet and furniture, it needs to be great on hardwood for various cleanups, it must be light and convenient to use, and of course, it needs to be cordless. This new LG checks all of those boxes plus it has a mop! 

Do not be scared off by the giant, heavy box that this comes in.  The tower that holds everything is incredibly easy to set up and the instructions are very detailed.  I had this up and running within 15 minutes.  I love how the tower holds all of the attachments plus an extra battery so I will never run out of juice.

The vacuum is light, powerful and does everything I need.  It picks up cat hair and litter with ease and does a great job on my carpeted floors.  The battery life is fantastic and the turbo modes give me the extra power when I need.

The tower works to empty the vacuum automatically so there is nothing stopping me from cleaning.  The mop feature is pretty cool too.  I have very shiny floors and it is tough to get them looking good, but this did the job well for quick cleanups.

I could not be happier with this system and look forward to many years of use."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,"May 18, 2022 12:03 PM",Maclemoor,Awesome vacuum tower,"The LG cordless zero A9 k is a beast of a machine. There are so many functions of this vacuum also mop that it’s hard to take it all in. The mop pads are super easy to connect disconnect take off and clean. Adding water to the tank is easy as well. It’s not a big water tank so using all of the water and cleaning out the tank makes for a cleaner reuse. Make sure you dry the water tank. The Wi-Fi is easy to connect if you have the app. I don’t use it because I don’t need it. But it is a good option. I put together the entire tower in less than 10 minutes. I like that it comes with two batteries. Straight out of the box I was able to vacuum part of my house. Charging takes overnight but  it also depends on what mode you use. Regular mode isn’t enough to pick up all of the dog hair. Power mode is a good option and last between 20 and 30 minutes.
Turbo mode only last seven minutes but it does pick up larger items. The fact that you have a second battery is also very helpful. The nozzles are able to be used on furniture and I can take it outside and use it in my car. The sound is fairly loud when you hook up the vacuum to the tower for the automatic empty. Not a big issue. I really like the compressor system because I’m able to vacuum a lot more without emptying more often. Overall this is a great vacuum I am unsure about the filter bags since we have a puppy we will go through a lot of them."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,"Feb 20, 2023 3:31 PM",EarlH,"Ultra-convenient, still not a real vacuum","Using this thing is a breeze. The all-in-one stand is a new bare minimum feature I would expect from stick vacuums moving forward. It really solves so many problems for stick-vacs (ie. clean & easy emptying, charging, tool storage, extra battery!!). Plus its looks are premium and second to none. Much more mature aesthetic than Dyson imo. Having owned a Dyson v7, this one is miles ahead in virtually every way.
However, this is not a real vacuum. It can't compete for the price point against a high quality canister like the Miele C3. Seriously, this is 75% of real vacuum at the very best. Personally, I would choose a plug-in all day over this. But, for those who know they want a battery-vac, or those who already have a working plug in which they want to add to, this is as good as it gets.
Five Stars."

Now Lg love how it works spare battery does wonders for extra cleaning. Compressor knob is awesome(plastic though). Best of all it self cleans when your full at the station. Test average 85-87mins of run time on auto low rugs, 55ish on lvl 2/65% pwr and about 25mins on full mode using both batteries. Found auto suction is as good has lvl2 from dysons v11 animal edition. So far have had this since black friday 2022 batteries are holding up to weekly use/drain. Now for a few con's only 2 things i find bad is wifi connection(needed to monitor vacuum bags and recommend maintenance updates yes lg app tells you maintenance) and the bags themselves. You have to buy extra bags to make this vacuum useable you can still drop into trash can. Thats the reason for the 4/5 stars. Other than that technology on this vacuum is awesome. For those thinking about house size 2story 2100+sqft house 80% carpet upstairs and 30% downstairs after vacuuming still have 20% left in 2nd battery on auto."

I love LG products so when the salesman suggested it we went for it, without reading the reviews. Got it home, put it together and after vacuuming about 20 sq feet of an oriental rug it started to whir three times and died…plugged.   Put it on the stand to clear and that didn’t work.  You have to pull out the metal part in the middle of the canister and maneuver your hand to try and clear the too small pipe that feeds the canister.  This machine constantly clogs on anything from pet fur to tiny cellophane candy wrappers.  If you are lucky you can finish vacuuming an 8 x 10 rug if you manually empty it three times.   I’m allergic to dust so a self cleaning vacuum would have been sooo nice but I was constantly manually emptying it.  The other features are great.  It’s light and easy to maneuver.  Suction was good.  It’s quiet and was the first vacuum that didn’t scare my dog. The accessories were plentiful.  It had style and was ok in my dining room. Darn you LG.  I honestly tried. In fact I’m lucky I’m a total tach member and get more than 15 days to return. I bought another that is for pets and it’s doing a great job.  In fact the first time I used it I knew immediately that the LG suction was inferior based on what it was picking up on just the Oriental rug. I’m really not sure how this product got into production.  Great idea, poorly executed."

bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,4,"Sep 8, 2022 2:18 PM",LouRevue,A bit pricey but great vacuum for your home,"This is more of a vacuum station than just a regular old vacuum. It's a bit pricey but it's still a great vacuum for your home. 

This is your typical stick vac with a auto-emptying hub. It's quite nice in that you can empty the vacuum manually however, the base station had a feature where you can auto-empty it whenever you dock the vacuum. The base station itself looks good and looks refined. It's not just some gaudy tower that you shove in a corner and have it looking like an eye sore. With the different color options, you could color coordinate it with your decor if you wanted to so that it's stands out less. the footprint of the base station is pretty small so you can store it anywhere really without it getting in the way. 

Included with the vacuum are your usual attachments like a crevice tool as well as a floor scrubber which is nice. It doesn't vacuum up the liquid so it's really just a scrubber. There is a separate head attachment for the scrubber as well as some extra velcro pads to use on the scrubbing head. The attachments store inside the base station except the scrubbing head which attaches to the side. This also comes with an extra bag and filter for the vacuum. 

Another nice feature is the extra battery. You store/charge the battery in the top of the unit so if you need to vacuum the whole place, you won't have to worry about running out of power midway through. This works ok for cleaning out your automobile too since it's portable however it's a tab bulky to get into some corners. 

Last feature is the compressor. With practically all these bagless vacuums, the center filter eventually gets clogged with debris so you need to disassemble the unit and clean that out properly to ensure proper suction. There is a lever on the bin that moves up and down on the compressor which allows you to scrape off a good chunk of debris on the interior filter without needing to disassemble it which I found to be quite beneficial. You'll still need to disassemble the unit for proper maintenance however, with this cleaner, you can do it far less. 

Only real knock to the is the price tag. It is expensive for a vacuum and you could easily find a stick vac or even a larger corded vacuum for much cheaper. That said, this is more of a lifestyle item where you can have a great functioning vacuum and have it look good in your home."

bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,4,"May 25, 2022 10:06 PM",nkpstudios,Excellent All-in-One Solution for Vacuuming,"The LG CordZero All-In-One vacuum with storage tower is an excellent representation of what vacuums should become for the home user. This LG creation breaks away from the land of stick vacuum clones by offering a system not found anywhere else. An all-in-one, self-contained self-emptying charging station hides the messy side of vacuuming. This cleaning system competes in the elite top tier of vacuums against the granddaddy cyclone vacuum and other primetime names in cordless stick vacuums space. The beautifully designed stand/tower creates a place for everything, so attachments are neatly placed and visible in a stand that automatically charges and cleans the vacuum. Hence, it is ready when you need it to be. No more looking for attachments or where you left the spare battery. It is all in one tower for you. There is just a simple and well-thought-out execution missing from other brands.
 
Unboxing and Setup
Everything was well packed and secure - straightforward and intuitive to set up. Remove everything from the box, and you will see how everything fits together once you put the stand on the floor. I want to mention that it was a pretty heavy box at around 50lbs - for some, this may be a team lift, so plan accordingly. Once you place your stand, but all the accessories inside the tower and admire your work. Everything looks so lovely in that corner now, doesn't it!?!? This has smart connectivity, but I chose not to use it after it only supports 2.4GHz networks… REALLY? We are in 2022, and we still only support 2.4GHZ WiFi?
 
Performance and Differentiators
The most wonderful feature here on this vacuum is the simple use of an on/off switch. No more holding a trigger - press once, and you are good to go until you are finished. The inclusion of the electric mop is nice and offers added value and cleaning power for your arsenal. LG is changing the game here rather than copying the granddaddy of vacuums. The telescoping wand allows reconfiguration to compensate for differences in cleaning areas and user heights. The spare battery lives in a charging station just under the lid that you can quickly remove if necessary. The electric mop offers a floor scrubbing solution but isn't complete because it can't vacuum up like a dedicated electric mop to leave your floor streak-free. This is meant to be an agitator and doesn't suck up dirty water from the floor. Think a Swiffer with motorized scrubbers and then an air-dry with what's left on the surface.
 
Build Quality and Battery Life
The LG CordlessZero has just an okay build, almost entirely plastic build with beautiful minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing stand that will blend into any decor. I worry for those who drop their vacuum a lot of bang into things with all the plastic here. The attachments are all plastic, with the electric mop having metal. Now let's talk battery life here. I tested on the carpet with carpet head. I got about 35 mins on MEDIUM (+) power (probably could go a bit longer, but I finished. When set on TURBO and you get maybe 10 mins, and on NORMAL you get around an hour. I have never run out of battery yet during a cleaning session taking care of 3 levels with stairs and carpets in my 2500 sq ft place. Here are the specs straight from LG's website pertaining to the battery life for Normal (handy): 120min, Power (handy): 60min, Turbo (handy): 14min. With floor wand Normal (Stick): 80min, Power (Stick): 40min, Turbo (Stick): 12min.
 
Here is a quick list of my things that make this vacuum excellent and some things I wish were thought through again. Hopefully, these things can be addressed in future renditions.  
 
Love
-On/Off switch - no more trigger pulling for long sessions.
-Portable power - it's great for auto cleaning and quick cleanups. I take it to the office to touch up the desk and take it home.
-Lightweight in the hand - you can clean for a while as fatigue is reduced due to design and weight.
-Kompressor button - being able to touch the stuff in the canister without touching it is nice.
-Tower Stand - completely self-contained in a minimalist stand. No need to wall mount a charger.
-2 Batteries - two batteries provided with one stored and charged so it is always ready for a swap.
-Quieter - it is quiet, but the performance suffers as well. Run this on medium for better cleaning, and it still is quiet compared to other vacuums I tried.
-3 step HEPA filtration - clean, breathable air for those with allergies and who don't like to empty the bin.
 
C'mon Man!
-2.4GHz WiFi Networks ONLY! - only supports 2.4GHz networks… REALLY? We are in 2022, and we only support 2.4GHZ WiFi?
-Power button placement - Often, you can press it by just walking around with it or placing it on the dock.
-Maintenance - with all the features, there is maintenance. You need to maintain filters in the tower, the self-emptying part, and the hand unit.
-Deep cleaning performance - things sometimes don't get sucked up in one pass with minimal improvement in TURBO mode. Larger cereal isn't easily vacuumed.
-TURBO mode activation - it takes FOREVER to activate. It feels longer than 3 seconds but sheesh!
-No AUTO suction mode - highly disappointing to a vacuum in this range
-No on-wand clip for attachments
-Battery indicator - no timer useful with remaining battery life. Old style 3 bar battery for you to guess from. Minutes left would be more valuable as the rest of the pack provides these days.
-Tiny Dust bin capacity - 300ml, which is 40% smaller than competitors
-Non-removable bin - You cannot separate the container from the handle to clean like competitors
-Exhaust position - while using, you will get exhaust in your face. Use this on your stairs or anywhere you have the vacuum below your face and enjoy a blast of hot air. I slightly angle the handle, and it helps a little.
-Plasticky build - everything from the tube to the vacuum itself and its accessories are plastic! I hope you aren't rough and bang into furniture or walls. After a few drops with the wand attached, I don't see this lasting.  
-Battery life - isn't that great compared to others in the market, but you get two, so it is not as bad.  
-Roller drags - compared to other vacuums used on carpet, the head has a significant drag and pressure when going through medium shag rugs. It often ""digs"" into the carpet, and you have to push to regain control.
-Loud in Turbo mode - like REALLY loud!"

It is powerful and can replace a full-size vacuum for most everything but is far more convenient. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because while the self-emptying feature works great, the bags fill up quickly and are not cheap. But I'd still but it again...it's that good otherwise."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,3,"May 25, 2022 2:38 PM",Jack,Expensive feature-rich with mediocre performance,"The LG Cordzero “all-in-one” system is an interesting (and expensive) idea that tries to accomplish all things you’d expect from vacuum cleaners. The package includes most of the items I’d usually need for everyday use, and the impressive base station, though being quite large and hefty, is feature rich. The attachments are good, and so is the ergonomics. It is a truly multifunctional tool.
The stick vacuum itself is well designed and well-balanced. The motor, near the top end, is very compact for its power and the telescopic handle makes it very easy to use. After using it to vacuum carpets and some tile floors I didn’t feel much fatigue compared to my other stick vacuums. The roller head (Universal Nozzle) can move around to reach a lot of hard to reach places. However, with “normal” operation I felt the suction power is not that great - with my “moderately clean” carpets with the usual dog hair etc. I frequently switched to the “Power” mode (and a few times to the “Turbo” mode). This drastically reduced the battery life and had to swap out the provided 2nd battery almost all the time. Without the 2nd battery and the charging station, this would have been a no-go from the very start. Of course, this depends on what type of carpets you have and how dirty they regularly get, but for me I’d appreciate it a bit more under Normal mode. But this is a drawback for almost all cordless vacuums I have used so far. The highly-touted Kompressor technology is just a manual lever that pushes down the debris inside dust bin. This helps pack more dust before I need emptying, but more me looked like an over-hyped idea. One thing to point out that the package does not include the slim hard-floor nozzle, so maybe that would be a better head to use for non-carpeted areas. However I did not have the means to try that out.
As for the Mop Nozzle - I have to say I’m quite disappointed with it. Only water can be used as the cleaning fluid, and the speed is fixed. This made it almost ineffective if there’s a speck of dirt in my tiled floor. For my use case, it was an ultra-low-duty attachment, and would only be useful if I could use it every single day. It is very very limited in its use, so if you plan to use it be wary.
The other “powered” head is the Pet Nozzle, which lists a lot of limitations in the manual (it can’t be used with clothing, bedding, leather sofas, cushions, carpet, vinyl flooring, tiles, marble) which made me wary to use it all. There are also crevice tools and a combination tool (crevice and brush) included as well which are very handy. Using these heads without the telescopic handle effectively transforms this into a handheld vacuum that I used to clean my car interior.
The charging/base station, as I mentioned earlier, is quite big and heavy. LF provides a plastic base with rubber feet to keep it standing, and mounting kit is there to tether it to a wall if needed. I did not have an issue with it as long it was not in a high-traffic area. The station, along with housing the stick vacuum, can charge the included extra battery, and has nifty ways to organize the tools/heads. The star feature is the Auto-empty functionality that automatically cleans out the dust bin from the vacuum body and puts it into a removable dust bag. I found the feature to be very useful (especially when I’m feeling lazy and wanted to create as little mess as possible) albeit noisy. By default the station performs this auto empty procedure every time the vacuum is docked, but this can be changed easily. The only drawback I saw was that the dust bag fills up quite easily and I’ll run out of those (only 3 are included) soon.
In terms of ease of use and smart features: I consider myself a tech-savvy person and am always looking forward to trying out new techs. But this vacuum left me baffled a number of times. For the first few days, I had to get the user manual to figure out what needs to be done. That’s the price you pay for getting a “feature” rich machine, but in my opinion this may leave people a bit frustrated. The LG ThingQ app does not add a lot of functionality - it can store cleaning history and can perform “Smart diagnosis”. But since I haven’t faced any functional issues with it I can’t comment how well it can actually solve problems.
Overall, I like the LG Cordzero All-in-one system for trying to be an all-in-one solution. But I wish, for the price, I was getting a bit more performance. If you have a light-duty need this will be a very good solution, but given the price you have to really think about the pros and cons. This could have been great with the large feature-set, but its mediocre performance made it more gimmicky for my needs."

bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,"May 24, 2022 3:58 PM",CDF3,Nice vacuum with a lot of features,"The LG CordZero is a nice vacuum cleaner with quite a few features. Taking the vacuum out of the box was fairly easy and straight forward. Setting up the unit is fairly easy, but I’d highly suggest reading the manual. There are a lot of things I would have missed if I had not read the manual. The charging base station is pretty much already assembled out of the box. The only labor involved for the base station is placing the gaskets on the bottom of the base plate, and setting the charing base station onto the base plate. The vacuum does a fairly decent job on the different floors I used it on. It did OK on carpet, but I felt it could use a bit more power. This was even after I cracked it up to Power Mode and then to Turbo Mode.  I was able to use it to clean dirt and debris from my hardwood floors. I was a bit nervous using it on my hardwood floors because I only have the Universal Floor Nozzle. I had some debris that got caught underneath the nozzle and slightly scratched an area of my hardwood floors. Perhaps I may look into getting the Slim Hard Floor Nozzle that didn’t come with the unit I have. After I vacuumed the hardwood floors, I then used the mop pads to clean them. The water reservoir isn’t as large as a floor cleaner I own by a different manufacturer. I assumed I would have to fill it up a few times while mopping the floors. I was wrong, and it was enough to clean all of the hardwood floors and tile floors. It did a good job of disbursing the right amount of water. There’s a button to adjust the amount of water you want disbursed while mopping the floors. The mop pads turn in a circular direction, which you cannot adjust the speed at which they spin. The mop nozzle also comes with LED lights on the front that illuminate onto the floor while in use. The charging base station has a nice feature of automatically emptying the debris from the vacuum into a dust bag. Once the bag becomes full overtime, it will have to be disgarded. There’s no way to empty the bags and reuse them because they have a plastic slide rail attached to the top of each bag. I wish the bags were reusable or if they could have used a plastic bin that can be emptied. Over time the price of buying new bags might be costly. I empty most of the debris manually from the vacuum itself into a regular trash can before placing it on the base station. The charging base station comes in auto mode to empty the vacuum when placing in on the base station. This can become quite annoying because every time I place the vacuum on the charging station, it goes into the bag empty mode which is quite loud. I’ve now switched it to manual mode by pressing the Select Mode button on top of the base station. Now when I place the vacuum on the base station to charge, I don’t have to worry about it going into the bag empty mode. You also can’t remove the vacuum from the base station until it goes through the complete cycle. With it being in manual mode now, I don’t have to worry about that anymore. The vacuum also comes with an app that allows you to see the charging status, vacuum history, and other useful information. It was a bit tricky setting it up. I scanned the QR code on that’s located on the vacuum. It automatically took me to the App Store where I was able to download the app. Once I was able to open the app, it then asked me to create an account. Locating my vacuum was easy. I scanned the same QR code again using the app. By using the app to scan the QR code, it now adds the vacuum to your account. The tricky pars was setting up the WiFi. You have connect to the vacuum’s built in WiFi. When it asks for a password you have to type the last 4 characters of the WiFi name of your device twice with no spaces. After that, then the WiFi process is complete. Overall I’m pleased with the vacuum. With the power being slightly lower than what I expected, it has other features that make up for it. It’s still a bit on the pricey side though."

The vacuume works well on lighter duty cleaning such as bare floors, thin carpets and furniture. Reluctantly gets plugged easily on medium to heavy duty jobs.

bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,4,"Jun 1, 2022 3:39 PM",BigA,Step up but would have expected more for the price,"First there is not a lot that I can say bad about the stick vacuum. As a vacuum it does a good job. I have had better but no major complaints.  I will say on bare floors with any type of small particles it takes at least a couple of passes to get everything up but it’s not that much worse than other I’ve had (note that this is in the standard mode, you can use the turbo mode and it much better but you suffer in battery.
Pros 1. The extra battery is really nice no one room left and the battery dies. 2. The adjustable stick means that both me and my wife can use it at a comfortable level.  3.  The self evacuating chamber no more spill dust around the trash when emptying. 4. The WiFi connection with the lg apps more cool than any great benefit.
The marginal 1. The mop feature - while this is a great feature it performance is just ok, it clean most of the stuff however there is no ability to saturate or scrub. Those would have been nice and problem been a game changer
Now the con - 1. The size of the base is huge it takes some floor or wall space to store. Much larger than anything else I’ve seen. 2.  I did have a clog at the bend to the floor attached that required some time to break free.  Turn out to be balled up tape with a bunch of stuff attached.  3. And probably most important is the cost at 1K I think there are better option on the market.  I honest would go with one of the cheaper LG models and give up the self emptying canister and mop feature and save 500 to 600, however if you could find one on sale in the 700 range it would be worth it."

bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,"Jun 12, 2022 11:31 AM",MarkusMN,The All In One of Vacuums,"I have tried several vacuums and they have all their pros and cons. This is a very well designed and thought out system. It ranges from a compact vacuum cleaner to powerful upright with telescoping tubes for easy storage. 

The charging station serves multiple purposes as it holds the main unit, charges the vacuum, stores a charged spare battery, empires the dust compartment and has ample storage for the attachments.  The machine snaps right in place and plays a tone to assure you that it’s in place.  

The vacuum itself does a nice job on all surfaces. It has a power button to up the suction, but the normal setting works well for most jobs.  The cleaning head is smaller than normal, but this is a big plus for cleaning around corners, under furniture and other tight spots.  

One feature that really separates from the others is the spinning polishing head.  It has a water compartment with two spinning cloth pads to polish and clean linoleum, tile and wood floors. With two settings for water flow, it never saturated the floor and did a great job of putting just the right amount of moisture to do the job. The pads are easily removable and can be cleaned and reused.  

Finally, the battery life seems to be very good. I have been testing it for almost a week and I have yet to see the battery meter move.  

If you’re looking for an all in one solution, this is it."

bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,4,"May 22, 2022 1:51 PM",KKCNIck,Almost perfect Whole Home Vacuum,"Vacuum for the whole home. I have 2 regular vacuums. A stick vacuum and a small cordless D***Bust** vacuum. I was hoping this would replace them so I can have one system to clean all the areas of our busy home. The setup was pretty easy but there was not a master set of instructions, so it was just open this and find out where it goes kind of install. After 20 minutes it was complete. I did have extra parts but they were for replacement filters and maintenance as I found in the manual. I downloaded the LG ThinQ app and paired the unit to my phone. Took about 15 minutes and 2 tries but finally connected. 

Use: I like the main vacuum brush for cleaning the main area of the home. The whole unit is comfortable to hold and not too heavy. I like that it is just small enough to fit in all the areas in my home where we vacuum. Most of the floor is Tile and LVT. We also have pets so there tends to be a lot of hair to pick up. In the first use I filled the container up in 20 minutes. There was a beeping noise to alert me that it was full. I set it in the base unit, and it auto emptied. This was where everything started to click. I can just pick it up vacuum and set it in the base when it is full. That is all. Not having to plug in the wall and hold the cord was helpful in getting the chore done fast. Then I used the smaller brush attachment to clean the harder to reach areas of the floor. Each time emptying in the base unit. Finally, I attached the mop unit and mopped the floor. It seemed like it would polish the floor and take up any shoe marks, but I did not notice any benefit from the mopping function. The following days I used it to clean little area’s that I would see more pet hair building. Just being able to grab and go is nice. I feel like this is almost perfect. I wish there were more color options and that the main brush unit was a little wider. In all it keeps my 2900 sq ft home clean and both batteries are more than enough to clean it.

Pros:
Cordless
Condenses multiple cleaning tools
Light weight
Long battery life
Auto Empties waste

Cons:
Wish it was less dust prone on the top of the base unit
Wish there were more colors
Wish the Mop function was stronger
Wish the Container held more"

bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,"Jul 11, 2022 7:26 AM",Harry,best vacuum yet,love the separate battery option.  best vacuum we have purchased
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,3,"Jun 1, 2022 8:39 PM",mskelbel,CordZero,"I wanted to love this system. First of all, It took a while to unbox and set up this unit. The base's sides open to component storage. The top holds a battery charger for the 2nd battery. It's all quite compact and lovely when set up. I was surprised at the size of the capture bag in the base. It's smaller than I expected, but this about the dirt/debris being compacted into this bag so I imagine that it will take quite some time to fill it up.

Now, lets move on to the vaccuum itself I was excited to use it. I turned it on and gave it a push across the carpet that I vaccuumed and shampooed four days ago. I've had some powerful suction vaccuums including a pretty good cordless stick vac. This wasn't as powerful as I was expecting. I clicked the + to boost power, it was better but still not as great as I was expecting. I ran it for about 8 minutes and it started sounding weird, power going up and down and it shut off then beeped. There was a red light on the front flashing. It indicated a clog. I took the motor off the pole and saw a clog, pet hair, at the top of the neck. I tried and tried to get it out, even used a chopstick to pull out the clog. I could only pull out so much so I started pushing the rest to move down to the dirt canister. There's a lever to push down the dirt. It seemed like a really cool idea. However once this clog cleared the neck it is now stuck above that lever. I let it run and run to try to get it free, but no such luck. Maybe eventually it will clear. 

I then tried the mop feature. The instructions said to use water, no cleaning solution. I didn't get the clean I was hoping for and had to hand wash the mop heads had to be done before I was half done with my kitchen was actually rather disappointing. 

For the price, $999 I was expecting so much more from this system. It will be passable for light cleaning but if you have pets, or have deeper cleaning needs, I can't recommend."

-Lightweight and versatile
-Storage compartments in the tower

Con:

The Vacuum
The vacuum is lightweight and versatile. The multi position extending pipe can be detached, turning it into a handheld vac. It comes with the standard head, the crevice and brush attachment, the mop head, and a cleaning brush. The dust canister is small and the Kompressor is really just a ring that you push down to scrape the dust off the filter and compress it down. 

The Tower
The tower is the all in one serving as storage, charger, and auto emptying the vacuum. Aesthetically it’s nice and that doesn’t take up a lot of space. The sides open up for accessory storage, but it can only store the crevice, brush, and pet head attachment. The mop head is hung on a hook on the outside. The top opens up for the secondary battery charging. 

The main feature of the tower is the auto empty function which automatically empties out the dust from the vacuum and into a dust bag on the bottom. The bag is about the size of a bag of coffee, and two is included. An additional pack of three costs $20. It does a good job of fully emptying the dust canister, but it can be loud if only for less than 30 seconds. 

Cleaning
The suction could be better. While it can be powerful at max setting, I find that my other stick vacuum of the same price outperforms this one. On carpet, especially if you have pets, I find the suction on normal and medium somewhat disappointing. It’ll pick up surface level and some hair but it won’t pick up fine dust unless I activate Turbo mode. With Tubo on, it did pick up dust deep in the carpet but I have to go over the area a few times. On normal the battery will last about 30 mins, while Turbo will last about 10 mins.

On hard wood and tiles, normal was good enough, but the head would not pick up larger debris and just ends up pushing it around. 

The mop attachment is only good light cleaning. It only spins at one speed and can only use water. The amount of water can be adjusted between two settings or off.  It’s good enough for cleaning the bathroom floor or removing shoe prints of tiles. 

Maintenance
There’s quite a bit of parts that need regular maintenance. The vacuum has two dust filters that need to be cleaned along with the dust canister filter. The tower also has two filters along with having to change out the dust bags. The mop pads need to be hand washed. 

Is it worth it?
If you really detest the idea of having to empty the canister with your hands and like having the tower to store everything neatly, then yes. The vacuum is light and versatile, giving you an around cleaner. The suction is powerful at max, but there are others that can outperform it. To me, this vacuum adds more steps for the sake of convenience. Rather than emptying out the canister after use, eventually you’ll end up having to open up the tower to replace the bag and have more filters to clean out. Add to that the cost of additional bags."

bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,"May 24, 2022 9:55 PM",DMNFL,Space Saver and Great Features,"The LG - CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum is a great vacuum for my entire house.  I had a stick vacuum and a traditional vacuum and I used them in different levels of the house (upstairs/downstairs).  I have all hard floors downstairs and all carpet upstairs.  So I kept the regular vacuum upstairs and the stick vacuum downstairs, which I considered inferior to the stick for carpet.  Don't get me wrong, the stick vacuum that I had worked well, but the regular vacuum was better on carpet.  This LG - CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum solved the need for having two.  The LG - CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum works as well on carpet as my traditional vacuum and as well on hard floors as my stick vacuum.  The power is what I need for all of it.

The thing that I like the most is that this automatically empties when you put it back in the tower.  I never realized how convenient this is.  You just put it back in and it empties and the tower tells you when to empty the bag.  The battery life has been great and there is a second battery and a place in the tower to charge it, so you never have a time that the vacuum is out of commission.  The app is also great.  Connection was easy it has many stats, down to how many times you've used it and how long it ran.  I would recommend the The LG - CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum to anyone."

The station itself looks good. This all-in-one station is not something I can and should keep in the closet—and I actually like it that way. It looks good out in a corner where we can easily pull the vacuum out for cereal grain spills. The design looks neat, the other nozzles and connecting tools can be stored in the station compartments, and the vacuum automatically charges once you park it. The vacuum can automatically empty itself (or you can manually trigger it). It even has a charging / storage for an extra battery which, all you clean freaks with kids out there know how important it is to have a charged EXTRA BATTERY. 

Performance-wise, it is great. I have to use it on TURBO all the time though. The normal mode just does not cut it for me. Maybe I can use that to suck other things? I don’t even know what “other” things are. All I know is, when it comes to vacuuming, it’s either it sucks it or it doesn’t. The turbo does it and for cleaning regularly a 1500 sq ft space of wood floor, I have never encountered having to even use the spare battery.  Another winner for me is the mop tool. You pre-wet the attachment cloths, put water in the bin and I mop away! There is no turbo mode for mopping, but it does the job as well! And I have been using the mop for 40 -45 minutes at a time and I do not run out of battery. This is me going through each sliver of space, slowly on the floor and it mops nicely and consistently. Oh, best of all, it is CORDLESS. I do not have to keep transferring the plug or have to hold a cord up and around me to get mopping done.

This is just so well-thought out. Even the bags and filter replacement system is easy (which we have not really done after a week of use, because we don’t think about it--- the vacuum empties itself, remember?) It makes the lady of the house happy, and it makes us all happy too. 

We just threw away all our cleaning appliances—corded mops and other vacuum sticks. This is what design is supposed to be. All-in-one—It just made cleaning fun and easy."

I like the tower and help me to keep the vacuum clean without getting dirty. Overall, I recommend this vacuum."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,"Jan 11, 2023",LG cordzero A9,Good vacuum and mop,"I needed to replace my old stick vac after not being satisfied with its pickup and performance. I went to Abt store  and tested all the vacuums on display. The one that stood out was the LG A9. After buying one and using it for a week, it has very good suction (even on the lowest setting) plus 2 boost modes, pickup of fine dust, fur and large bits is great on carpets, the body is light and easy to carry around and it runs quieter than other vacuums due to the inverter motor. The filter is easy to access from the top of the main unit and comes with a spare. The wall mounted charge dock is convenient. The brush hasn't tangled with any hair yet. Overall this is a great choice in the stick vacuum world."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,"Jan 11, 2023",Aaron68174,The best All In One,"Had it for a while now, it's the first vacuum I've bought since a Dyson ball about 6 years ago. The LG's features are complete, there's almost nothing more I could ask for. Extra battery, complete set of attachments. Honestly I don't use the automatic empty that much because I like operating the whole thing manually, but it's great for spot cleaning. The tower matches my decor easily and gives me a nice organized central location for all things vacuum."

homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,"Jan 6, 2023",JojoR,"Amazing, that's all I can think of to say!","It was so easy to get everything set up and OMG I've never used such a strong vacuum in a stick before.  The thing I have never seen anyone mention is the corner cleaning.  One of the first things I noticed was that when I went along side a wall, that dirt was picked up very well.  I didn't have to go back in to the corners and brush things out it was just all gone!

It's a little heavier than I expected, but still very light and manageable even with my arthritis.

Having asthma, one of the hardest things about vacuuming for me was that I had to wait for my husband to get home to take it outside and empty the old ones before I could continue.  I don't have to worry about that anymore with this new vacuum because it does it all itself  How simple can it get!

The speed of the machine on it's normal setting is more than adequate for my needs.  Works great on my ceramic tile floors, wood floors and carpeting.  I'm good to go! Merry Christmas to me for sure!

I can't thank you enough for creating this vacuum.  It was definitely on the high priced end, but I think that purchase will be more than worth it!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,3,"Jan 3, 2023",TechieMomGA,Keep getting errors … troubleshooting each use.,"I literally used the vacuum 6 times before getting errors wachbuse. So I purchased another one to use on another level of the home hoping the issue was isolated to the one machine (which I’m in the middle of troubleshooting … cleaning all parts). Fingers crossed resolves the issues. If not LG, I’d like a refund :("

The suction is decent enough to pick up dog hair and perfect for everyday use. It’s so nice that I don’t need to empty the canister when I’m done vacuuming. It does it for me when I dock the unit. I have not replaced the bag yet after 4 weeks of use so that’s another positive. It’s a tad pricey but overall I’m pleased with this purchase.
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,"Dec 27, 2022",Woospike,Great product,I bought this a month ago and am using couple of times a day. It’s a great product with easy handling. It works great with the right size and weight.

homedepot,LG A939KBGS,4,"Dec 25, 2022",Ceyda,All sweep!,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Cordless feature with 2 charges and automated trash box are my favorites with this model. It is lightweight and easy to maneuver. Mop attachment is a plus.
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,4,"Dec 25, 2022",Steven Fulghum,Solution Mindfulness,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have had my eye on this product since shortly after its introduction.  Previously, I had a separate electric mop and stick vac with accessories that were 'all over the place' and difficult to keep them organized.  I am very happy with my purchase.  I find the quality of the product very good.  I like the style factor, the power of the vacuum, and the ability to organize accessories centrally.  And yes, the extra battery is fantastic because my previous Dyson pooped out on, it seemed, 5 minutes before I could finish a chore.  Plus, the self-emptying feature is very convenient.  My feedback concerns the mop capability.  It simply needs to be stronger.  I would characterize this by what I see in the results and that this functionality simply takes too many passes to achieve expected results (vs. w/my separate electric mop as a comparison).  I will take on experimenting for more effectiveness, but regardless, I am happy to have this high quality, multi-functional device in my home."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,1,"Dec 18, 2022",Crews84,"Great Idea, Poor Execution",Continually got clogged with pet hair and eventually burned the motor out.  Lasted less than 6 months.
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,"Dec 16, 2022",TX Postmaster,Love the Auto Empty,Have used this vacuum for 3 weeks now.  It is easy and convenient to use.  The Cleaning/Charging/Storage tower is very functional and does not look bad sitting in the corner of the living room.  Our reasons for selecting this Stick Vacuum were:  1st was the Auto Empty; 2nd it came with 2 rechargable batteries; 3rd the power mop attachement.
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,"Dec 13, 2022",Michael H in Houston,This thing is amazing!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was skeptical when I ordered the LG CordZero but the more I read about it the more I wanted to try it out.  With two old dogs (17 and 23… yup. That’s right) I vacuum every single day of my life. The biggest issue was having to pull the vacuum out, constantly unplug it to move it it around the house and then wrap the cord up and put it back up. It was a royal pain. 

I honestly thought I wouldn’t have the power with a cordless option, but it’s not the case in the slightest.  The best part is I have the tower in the living room and it looks great. Modern, out of the way yet very convenient to use and  It recharges quickly. I’ve yet to have to use the second battery. The attachments are out of the way and seem to work great as well. 

It is absolutely worth the investment. 

So far, I’m very impressed and look forward to using it."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,4,"Dec 12, 2022",Anonymous,Love the convenience of this vacuum!,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Very convenient and easy to use. But it has a hard time picking up solids on the wood floors. I’m not sure why it wouldn’t suck up my sons dried up top ramen noodles. Other than that I love the versatility and ease of use.

Light weight and easy to use without that annoying trigger! Worth the price and the hype. The only cons would be that it needs a soft brush and a place to put sanitizer for the mop feature. LG you’re almost there!
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,"Dec 6, 2022",Angelita Fregoso,Best Cordless Vacuum Ever!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was debating if I should get this vacuum or not because as you all know this vacuum isn’t cheap, but upon reading all the reviews I was convinced. When I first put it together I must say I didn’t think it was all that good as advertised. The suction isn’t as strong as I thought but considering it’s battery operated that’s to be expected. I just got a chance to use it now I’m obsessed!! Although suction isn’t that strong it’s enough. I’m happy with this purchase and I do recommend it."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,"Nov 22, 2022",JHCCAZ,CordZero vacs are QUIET! Love Auto Empty bagging!,"We now have three households in our extended family with the Cord Zero all in one Auto Empty model.. I need encouragement to keep up with dusting, and so I appreciate the convenience ofa cordless vac but I hate dealing with emptying any Bagless vac which are the most popular these days. The feature of having bagged and filtered emptying into the recharging station is a great solution. By the way, the station also works for emptying other Cord Zero models, even the non-compressor units seem to work fine. So we keep our previous model upstairs and use the downstairs Auto Empty station for it as well.

The other big point, which LG doesn't seem to promote very much, is that these vacuums are notably quieter than most competitors. We previously had one of the competing models from the well known deluxe brand, and I hated it because it was so loud and very shrill sounding. The LG is deceptively powerful considering how much quieter it runs. Of course you can boost the speed, but even on Turbo the LG is not as hurtful to the ears. Note also that dogs and cats are more sensitive to loud high pitched noises than we are, they don't run away from this vacuum like they did with the other one. This quietness benefit is hard to prove from just reading the websites. Check out the Project Farm video comparison on YouTube where he reports the measured sound level of all tested units. LG is at or near the quietest and is still competitive in other performance categories."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,"Nov 20, 2022",Nancy5246,Everyone needs this vacuum,"I have had this vacuum for about 2 weeks and I’m obsessed. I had always had a stick vacuum for about 10 years, and hated having to empty it constantly when I vacuumed. I have 2 dogs, and the hair filled up my Dyson in 10 minutes. Then I would have to pull the dog hair out with my fingers. Ugh!! It was horrible. Now that I have the LG auto emptying vacuum, it is an absolute pleasure vacuuming my house. I never have to pull dog hair out to empty the vacuum again. What a game changer. Worth every penny!!!! I cannot recommend this vacuum enough."

homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,"Nov 6, 2022",Anonymous,Very High Quality Unit,"I have been using this vacuum for 6 months now and I am very impressed. All the materials are high quality. It does a good job of emptying the dirt out when you stow it. Super easy to use, I would highly recommend this to anyone. The mop attachment actually works good on my hard wood floors. I was worried that it wouldn't perform well since there wasn't any suction and it was just a mop. But it actually picks up a lot of dirt and does a good job scrubbing. 10/10 would recommend. 

I have a 2000 square foot house that is 50/50 carpet and hardwood and I never go through a single battery. So the second battery isn't really needed. The first battery seems to last for almost an hour. And with how dusty Texas is I usually fill up the container in 20-30 minutes and hang up the vacuum. So I have never had to swap out the battery."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,4,"Nov 1, 2022",Mactastic,AUTOMATIC EMPTYING INTO A BAG!,"I received this vacuum about a week ago, and I’ve been using it for every day cleaning of my entire house. It has powerful suction, and it’s much quieter than cordless vacuums I’ve purchased previously. My favorite feature is the self-empty base, which automatically empties the contents of the dust bin into a sealed bag. No longer do I have to touch the contents of the dust bin, which will always be a plus. I simply remove, and throw away the bag, then insert a new bag into the self-empty base. Let’s not forget that the vacuum comes with not one, but two batteries that I can swap when one runs out of juice. The self-empty base will charge the additional battery while I’m vacuuming. With this vacuum I can track my cleaning history over Wi-Fi with the LG ThinQ app. Unfortunately, it isn’t without flaws, and requires improvement. Prepare to cut and/or remove long hair from the brushroll. It’s best to have a nozzle that prevents long hair from wrapping around the brushroll. Also there’s no illumination on the nozzle so I can’t see what I’m vacuuming."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,"Oct 31, 2022",Kymbro,Love the ease of vacuuming now!,"I've had this just over a week and absolutely love it! Is it the strongest, most powerful vacuum that'll efficiently do shag carpets? No. But it's great for picking up cat litter off the vinyl floor and I've been more apt to do that with this cordless beauty. I threw away my little broom I used to use. I'm not sure what I like best the cordless feature or the self-cleaning feature. 
Also I like the mop! Is it the best? Again, no. But it's sufficient for small areas at a time. It's a bit slow but on my vinyl flooring it works fairly well. 
I was nervous to spend the amount I spent on this but I'm glad I did thus far!!"

With the different attachments or tools makes this vacuum a versatile and very light weight vacuum that our money can buy now a days..
Now the self emptying feature it makes me love it even more …
Love it.. definitely would recommend it to family and friends"

The difference attachments make this vacuum one of the most versatile, if not THE most versatile (and lightweight!) vacuums money can buy currently! The LG mobile app this device pairs with could use some refining. The self emptying feature is me and my 2 year old sons favorite feature by far. The only thing I wish was different about this product is that it came with more dust bins for the self emptying feature within the housing for the vacuum. Overall I am happy with this purchase! Thanks LG!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,4,"Sep 7, 2022",hjh2c,Love this LG CordZero Vaccuum!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have recently gotten the LG Electronics CordZero Vaccuum and love so many things about this handy device! The vacuum came with so many assorted attachments including one for pet hair and a mopping attachment. It also came with an extra battery which I love!  The run time on one battery is a little over an hour if I keep it in auto mode and don't switch to Turbo. I love having that extra battery on hand and charged up the Tower when I need it. One unique feature about the CordZero is that it's handy base recharges it, stores the extra parts, battery and attachments as well as has an Auto Empty feature for cleaning out the debris from the vacuum dust bin! I love that is takes one more clean up step out of my normal routine! The tower is makes keeping all of the extra things that can be used with the vacuum so nice and tidy and in one spot for easy access. The vacuum is lightweight and the main attachment is easy to get around and under furniture. I like that the main attachment head is a bit smaller than some of the others I've seen as it can really get into tight spaces and under chairs. I love that when I turn it on, I don't have to keep holding down on a button to keep the suction going as I've had to do on vacuums I've had in the past. It does seamlessly from my hardwood to my tile to my carpet rugs and has a great Turbo mode that can be turned on for those places I worry have extra hard to reach dirt. The CordZero even has ap app that you can connect to that will show you run times. extra info on the troubleshooting and battery life. I think one of the super exciting things about the CordZero is that it has a mop attachment. Although this feature didn't live up to my expectations, I'll thrilled of the idea of a vacuum/mop combo!  The mop attachment has a place to put in water and it has little round pads that velcro on to the vacuum and spin around once you start it up. You can control the amount of water that comes out (it has a low to high setting) but the problem  I had was that I didn't think it really ""mopped"" my floor. There was moisture but it can't be used with soap or cleaner of any kind and I just don't feel like my floor are properly ""mopped "" with just a slight layer of water. I used the microfiber mop heads for about 15 minutes on my tile while I was trying out the mopping feature and once done, the mop heads were already frazzled and looked to be coming undone. I love the IDEA of the mop combo, but in my ideal world, it would have been able to be used with a cleaner to really get it good and clean and I would have more function in the amount of water that comes out ( I couldn't tell much difference in the low or high adjustments on the mop attachment). Also, the suction is turned off when you use the mop attachment and I would love to see a function added to be able to use the mop with water and cleaner and then have it sucked back up or go back over the water with a drying function. Again, I love the idea, but feel like the mop attachment could have some improvement to make it a 5 star product. I do like that the mop attachment has a little blue light that shines to help show you where the water is on the floor. Overall, I am thrilled with the uniqueness and creativity that this LG CordZero Vacuum brings to my home. The tower with it's multitude of functions is a real game changer in my book!"

It is a cordless vacuum which makes it very easy to clean because u can pick it up and go anywhere with it. There are two batteries that come with it so you can change it out when one is done for uninterrupted cleaning. There is all in one tower. The tower serves as a battery charging station that charges two batteries. You can clean and charge them at the same time with 120 minutes.it also  conveniently and discretely stores tools and accessories. Inside the tower there is also an auto empty that empties the dirt cup when the vacuum is docked.there are three vacuum bags that come with it for emptying debris. it has Kompressor technology that compacts the dirt inside the dust bin. It has one touch press button that turns it on/off or you can select turbo power mode. The vacuum has a telescopic wand so you can adjust it to reach those high places. This vacuum is also a mop! It comes with mop heads and a power mop nozzle . You can mop hardwood floor with this and you can easily vacuum them too. It cleans carpets with ease and picks up pet hair very well too with the pet nozzle. It has Wi-Fi ThinQ which helps so you can run your vacuum for maintenance and diagnostics for upkeep ! Overall this vacuum is fantastic to have!!
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,"Sep 6, 2022",Jay323,Fantastic features,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This vacuum is by far better than fantastic. The feature that this has are amazing. Let me start with the sucking power of this vacuum. When this is on normal it is strong and great for loose crumbs, pet hair , dirt, etc. click it up to turbo and it get down deep in the carpet for dirt a normal vacuum can’t get. Next let’s go to the battery life. 2 batteries are more than enough to clean an entire house (my house is 2800sq/ft) and I have battery to spare. Let’s move on to the accessories you get all the tools you need to clean furniture under heat registers to tight spaces behind fridges and under tables. The wet mop head is efficient in cleaning your hard floors to a great shine and clean the mop head is very easy. Now let’s go to the base, it hides all the tools neatly and it looks modern and no one would know what is in there. The base also sucks out the dirt from the unit into a bag in the base for a hands free cleaning of the dirt out of the unit. Finally the wi fi option is great. Get the app and it tell you how much the vacuum is used, when the batteries are fully charged, the last day you vacuumed, how long you vacuumed, etc. This is a very durable product and is well worth the purchase. I don’t know how I made it with out one of these. NO POWER CORDS is great as well. All wireless."

homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,"Sep 3, 2022",littlerabbit,The perfect vacuum!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've been very impressed with this vacuum so far. Took a bit to set it all up but once you're done you have an all-in-one tower/charge station that contains everything you need. All the attachments are stored inside the tower - no clutter at all! The actual vacuum is sleek and lightweight, and the lack of a cord offers so much freedom. It transitions easily between carpet and hardwood floors, and suction is strong even without going into the highest setting. It comes with an extra battery that sits in the tower until you need it, but I haven't had to use it yet! The main perk of this vacuum is the auto-emptying feature; once you've finished vacuuming you just place it back into the charge station and it'll empty itself into a bag installed inside. You can set this to automatic or manual with just a press of a button (and if you're wondering if you can still manually empty it, you can!) There's also an app you can use, and while it's not required to use the vacuum it's very useful to have as it greatly helps with maintenance. I'd recommend it even if you're not a big fan of constant apps like I am. Overall I'd say it's exceeded my expectations. It's plenty strong and the convenience of going cordless is just too good. You'll definitely love cleaning with this vacuum!"

Set up was so simple for the tower, the vacuum itself, and the Wi-Fi/ThiQ app. First thing I did was get the batteries charging. Being able to charge the extra battery to have ready at all times is convenience at its finest! Next up was putting all the accessories in their place inside the tower. How wonderful to have a place for everything, right where you need it. I enjoy vacuuming so much more when it’s cordless. Cleaning can be a pain, having to drag a cord behind you, needing to switch plugs when you move onto a farther room! I am ecstatic to be cord free! I am able to go directly from the hardwood floors, to the tiled floors, and right to the carpet with ease. There’s no change in suction, no switch needing to be switched. It’s completely effortless. The battery life is superb. Two-story home, multiple bathrooms and bedrooms, a loft, kitchen, dining room, office, and a laundry room… all vacuumed with battery still remaining, 1/3rd to be exact. Let me tell you, you never knew you needed your vacuum to empty itself until you have this LG CordZero Vacuum!! I never would have thought that would be my favorite feature. It’s incredible! The pictures I have attached are from the first use, after vacuuming with my current vacuum the day before! This not only shows that the suction power of the Smart Inverter Motor can get what your current vacuum is leaving behind, but also how well the auto empty feature works! Just when you think this vacuum can’t get any better…  Power Mop attachment! Amazing! This one vacuum has been able to replace three cleaning tools (stick vacuum, dust buster, and mop) for me and I am so thankful!"

The ThinQ app will help with maintenance of the vacuum. It has a gratis that will automatically empty the debris that you've vacuumed after each time you use the vacuum. With the kompressor, you can compact debris you've picked up giving additional space to finish vacuuming.  The wand is adjustable in length. There are three modes of vacuum power."

It’s awesome! It is high quality and well made. The construction of this compares to other stick vacs is top notch. The tube is metal where most others are plastic. The mop function is amazing and quick when there is a spill, and I love all of the stick vac accessories that come with it. The auto empty function saves us a ton of dust in the house now that we don’t need to empty our vacuum manually! I love it, and I don’t know how I lived without it before!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,"Sep 1, 2022",Goldfish12,Amazing,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I am very impressed by this vacuum. It has amazing suction and the noise level is very low. There are so many attachments which I love. It's very sleek and slender so it easily fits into any space. My only complaint are the doors. There is not latch so they can easily swivel open.
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,4,"Sep 1, 2022",CJM2,Great When it Works,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So many appliances now are highly advanced and innovative. They come with mobile apps and lengthy instructions. This vacuum is something new for sure. I am usually not a huge fan of mobile apps for everything but knowing when the vacuum is fully charged or has an issue by checking my phone can be handy sometimes.

 As for the vacuum itself; it works well. I, personally, had no issues with suction. Honestly, I tried all the settings and I can't imagine why anyone would need to use the Turbo function. I can't see how anyone would use that for regular day to day vacuuming. It's REALLY high intensity. The normal, basic setting is just fine for most floors, rugs and carpets. I think the suction is exceptionally good actually. It's amazing how you think something is clean and then see how much dust and hair gets picked up. 

The pet attachment is handy for small areas that just need a quick clean up. The mop feature is interesting, I probably won't use that one as often. It does work just fine but I just don't like the extra clean-up of the device afterwards. What I really like this for is stairs. It's so much easier to maneuver than a regular vacuum and I can get the corners and angles of the stairs much easier and faster. 

The automatic empty feature is pretty cool but I find that it only completely emptied the dust container about half the time. Even after compressing it and making sure it's not too full. Sometimes there will still be a bit of debris left that has to be manually emptied. However, that was not a big problem for me. I like the compact base station where you can store and charge the vacuum and all the attachments in one place. It's easy to assemble, charge and to set up.

 My main issue is the sensitivity of the vacuum. It reminds me of old smartphones that had the capability to take very high-resolution photos but the phone itself would practically shut down when you used the feature. A lot of high-tech devices have this issue. They design the appliance to be very advanced but, counterintuitively - also too sensitive, so that it requires constant maintenance just to keep it functional on the most basic level. This is a big issue for me because when I clean; I want to get it done quickly and efficiently. I don't like stopping every few minutes and having to check the vacuum because it's saying it's ""blocked"". Only to have to completely disassemble the entire thing to figure out what tiny bit of fluff is supposedly ""blocking"" it. The usual culprit of the ""blockage"" is a tiny dust bunny or some barely visible piece of fluff that I have to spend 5 minutes and a tweezer to find. More times that I like; I had to give up and just use my regular vacuum cleaner to finish my chores. A big deal breaker for me because I don't like having to walk on eggshells around my appliances because I'm not sure if they'll work or allow me to get my tasks done that day without issue. That is my only but most major con.

Other than that; this vacuum is very good for basic tasks and day to day cleaning. Great for stairs and small areas. Good suction and helpful features and attachments."

homedepot,LG A939KBGS,4,"Aug 31, 2022",arb71,Super light and easy to use,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I like this vacuum a lot because it is super lightweight and easy to push.  It doesn't hurt my back to vacuum using this vacuum. The fact that it empties itself into the tower is a great feature and so simple. The only downside to this vacuum is that it doesn't really seem to get down into the carpet.  It seems to just glide over the top rather than really do deep cleaning.  Other than that, I love it."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,4,"Aug 31, 2022",Matt Sc,"Quiet, Great Vacuum, Eh Mop, Proprietary Bags","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Wow, I was not expecting so many parts and pieces to arrive in such a large box. After getting over my initial shock, everything was pretty straightforward to put together and all of the components and attachments either store in or hang on the base, so it doesn't take up as much room as I feared.

The vacuum itself is deceptively quiet and works great. We have a similar style stick vacuum from another well known brand and it must be 2-3 times louder than this vacuum, but seems to perform the same. We have a dog that'll dash out the doggy door when our old vacuum turns on. With this vacuum, she's still not pleased, but she'll hang out one room over instead of making a beeline for the backyard.

The vacuum itself comes with a number of attachments-- a general floor head (with spinning brushes) a narrower pet hair head (with spinning rubber flaps) and a mop (no suction, just rotating pads). It also has the usual brush, crevice tool, etc. One cool thing worth mentioning is that the aluminum tube (between the vacuum and head) is extendable, so this is actually comfortable to use while standing-- you don't have to hunch over.

For performance, I find that you can get about 15 minutes out of one battery on the highest speed, but closer to 45 minutes with the lowest speed-- which has more than enough power for hardwood floors, etc. This set also comes with a spare battery (that sits under the lid of the storage tower and is always charged), so you can actually get some cleaning done in between charges.

The general flooring head with the bristles works well-- it picks up pretty much everything. The rubber flap head for pet hair is okay. It does good for hair that is fresh on the surface (so couches, car seats, etc)-- but it does not work miracles. If you have a rug with hair that's worked in over the past 2 years and is really embedded in there, not much will get it out, including this head.

The mop head is a bit of a disappointment. It has a small reservoir, you can't use hot water, and you can only use plain water (no cleaning solutions). Because of this, it's really limited in its usefulness for me.

Finally, the base/storage station is pretty slick. It always keeps the vacuum charged (expected), does a good job at holding all the accessories (good design), but the real feature is the auto emptying of the hand vac. If it's in AUTO mode, as soon as you dock the vacuum, it pops it open, sucks out all the dust and gets it ready to go again. I turned it off of AUTO because it is loud. It's basically as loud as a corded vacuum cleaner when it goes off. Overall, I love it. My only disappointment is that it empties the vacuum into a proprietary LG vacuum bag that they are currently pretty proud of. Hopefully a third party comes out with a more economical choice in the future.

So, final verdict? I love it, it's sleek, works well, is quiet, and is well thought out. Don't buy it for the mop feature (more of a gimmick in my eyes) and do be aware of the ongoing costs of the proprietary bags (though you can manually empty the vac into your own trash can, but that kind of negates the best feature of this system-- the auto emptying), but if you can get past those, then I think you'll really like what LG did with this product."

The mop has a light, come on LG."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,1,"Jun 19, 2022",tt226,Brand New Unit Came Broken,"I was very happy and excited to open this new product. The concept of this vacuum was different, which had me switch over to LG (coming from owning several Dyson vacuums and other Dyson products). After watching many reviews on this vacuum and seeing other people un-boxing videos. I had high hopes for this product. However, the extension pipe arrived with a dent mark. Another worst thing, the main unit was not sucking up any of the dirt! The dirt bin was completely brand new, even after vacuuming the whole basement. The vacuum powers on (for certain attachments) and off, WI-FI worked and connected to device. The power mode did not work at all. The speed of the vacuum was the same, even when trying to switch it to turbo mode. It's like it has only one mode. The lowest mode possible. With the standard attachment, the brush would spin like normal and managed to pick up some debris from the carpet. As soon as I lift the vacuum up, all the debris fell back on the carpet. When I place my hand near the attachment, I can feel the air flow coming out. I tried all the little attachments, couldn't even get the power to turn on. Both batteries were fully charged. 

I reached out to LG support and the representative suggested to ship the main unit back to them for repairs and diagnostic but it'll take 3-5 days to get the shipping box. Plus an additional 7 days for them to do the repairs. The extension pipe is in for replacement. Honestly, for a product that is this pricey. I'm very disappointed. A vacuum that doesn't even vacuum.... I had zero issue with my other vacuums. You buy a product brand new hoping everything will work properly on the first try. 

Just a very bad experience. Will update the review once the unit is repaired. But so far, I'm not sure how I feel about this product. I can't tell you to skip the hassle and go with another brand. At this moment, that's what I'm leaning towards. But I will give it another try once it's fixed."

homedepot,LG A939KBGS,2,"Apr 29, 2022",Syd34,Underwhelming,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I bought this vacuum as an investment, I thought it would be a high quality, enjoyable and easy to use. However the suction is extremely weak and to even get to enough power it has to be at the most powerful turbo mode which only lasts for seven minutes on a four hour battery charge. If this is how weak it is now I hate to think how useless it will become once it starts to lose power. The features on this otherwise are both useful and well made so it having so little power is extremely disappointing. Plus the one tiny wheel is not large enough making using this vacuum extremely hard to move on carpet most vacuums pull away from you and are able to pull in dirt surrounding the outside of the tool but this is unable to do either. Finally the feature that allows you to adjust the height is very nice in thought but due to the fact that it often unlocks during use making it shrink and grow with movement makes it irritating and overall more difficult to use. I was extremely disappointed by all of this as I’m usually a fan of lg products as my fridge, washer, dryer, stove, etc. are all lg products. I hope lg is able to improve on this product and bring it to match the higher standard of its other products."

I mostly use a vacuum to clean up our house about twice a week, we have 50% carpet and 50% vinyl floor, with this vacuum I can use it on both surfaces.  
The auto empty charging station is so well-made and very user-friendly, you can store the extra tools inside the station. 
The auto empty design is really impressive!  So convenient and really work perfectly, so after a few weeks, the vacuum still looks brand new!
The filter inside the vacuum is so easy to change or clean, there are so many extra nozzles and tools, all well-designed and high quality.
The most and the best is the owner's manual is so clear and easy to understand. 
Overall I highly recommend this vacuum!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,"Nov 26, 2021",Bbjniles,"Beauty, power and function!","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Wow, wow, wow…this LG CordZero Vacuum is incredible.  It looks so sleek and modern, it holds and hides most of the attachments, it empties itself, and is an absolute workhorse.   This is a great piece of equipment…LG has really outdone itself!

I will say that removing it from the box can be a little intimidating.  There are a lot of wrapped pieces, and a ton of instructions.  That said, it is intuitively built, so assembling everything is a breeze.  The tower opens to reveal cubbies for the three attachments and the brush for occasional cleanings.  There too is the bag that holds the refuse when the vacuum is emptied.  This is behind a door, so when the tower is opened, everything is put away and tidy.

It also comes with a power mop head, though this is very large and will have to be stored separately.  Still, we already had a power mop, so we are actually saving room since we can get rid of it, and only have to store the mop head for the CordZero.

And while we are here, I will say that the mop head works very well, spinning vigorously, and sparing your back, as traditional mopping requires much more elbow grease.  The pads attach using Velcro, and are easily removed and cleaned.  There is a water reservoir and two setting to choose from in terms of wetness.  This head is (as too are all the attachments) easily installed and removed.

The stick portion of the device requires depressing a sliding button to choose your desired length, so it works well for those of most heights.  

There is a power bottom on the handle, which is great for those with weak hands or aching joints.  Many stick vacuums require you to hold a trigger down, which can be difficult and annoying, but not so with the CordZero.  There are three settings, the lowest being fine for most all the time.  The battery lasts around an hour, though that varies whether we are using it on our wood floors or carpets.  The top setting eats the battery quickly, so we rarely use it.  Still, it comes with two batteries, one of which charges in a cubby at the top of the tower while not in use, and you are meant to trade them with each run (as they will, according to the instructions, lose their ability to hold a charge over time).  We haven’t experienced reduced battery yet, so I can’t comment on that.  The batteries seat nicely in both the vacuum and tower.

This thing really is a marvel to look at, especially considering it’s a vacuum.  The tower is spare and modern, casting minimalistic lines, and not drawing undue attention, but fitting in well.  This is great for us, as we don’t have a closet with an outlet inside, so the CordZero has to stay out in a room.  I imagine this is true for many people, so that fact that it looks so clean is a huge plus…it doesn’t clutter up your space, but instead blends into it.

The vacuum does feel a bit heavier that precious stick vacuums we’ve owned, but none are as feature robust, and most are corded so you can’t free range your home with them.  It is quite loud when you place it in the tower and it empties itself, but it only lasts a few seconds, so it doesn’t cause much distraction.  Too, this certainly has more power than I expected, so kudos to LG for that.

We really are over the moon with the CordZero…it can do everything, so were able to declutter by removing  an old corded stick vacuum, and a corded power mop.  And we can do it in high style.  

From the aesthetics to the functionality, the LG CordZero is top notch, and I really couldn’t recommend it highly enough!"

I love how the attachments store in the stand so they won't get lost. Also the self emptying is so cool. My husband is looking forward to using it to vacuum out his truck since it can also be a hand vac. I cannot recommend this enough! It makes vacuuming fun and my kids actually WANT to vacuum.

When he was done, I took the LG CordZero and went back over the carpet. Wow! I got quite a bit in the canister. My husband was impressed. I also love that the stand has self-cleaning. The dust that you typically have to deal with is non-existent when emptying out. I am so thrilled with this vacuum. I have not yet had the opportunity to use the mop feature on our hardwoods.

homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,"Nov 14, 2021",MeganM33,Best vacuum I've ever used,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] WOW! This LG cordzero blows away any Dyson I've ever had (I've had 3 models) and the Shark that I most recently started using. It is quieter, the auto empty feature is downright amazing, and it has a perfect amount of power to pick up the hair from my 2 dogs plus all the grass clippings that inevitably get tracked into the house. 

I haven't even tried the mopping option yet, but I am sure it's amazing as well. 

I will say that the amount of instructions that come with this device are plentiful - so many different instruction booklets and cards made it a little confusing but I guess when it comes to directions for a new device, more is better than less. 

I love how this vacuum is small enough to fit under furniture, like beds, to clean. Also it's sleek appearance has me not even minding that it sits out in the living room! It does have to be plugged in so it can charge - which makes storing it in a closet difficult. But it's so nice looking that it doesn't even matter.

Its much quieter than traditional heavy duty vacuum cleaner but little nosier than its competitor. 
Vacuum cleaner is highly efficient in cleaning the floor. Highly effective on every thickness of the carpet. If small carpets roll in the vacuum cleaner, just stop the vacuums cleaner and it easily comes off.  It works just fine. Smooth in operation. Mop feature is also highly effective. Battery life is pretty good. It comes with spare battery so no issue of running out of juice. Really impressed with its aesthetic.
Tower is designed just to the perfection. Its compact in nature. Looks good. It can accommodate attachments which was impressive. (which helps a lot in our case) Emptying the vacuum cleaner in auto mode is absolutely easy, just hang it up and it will job for you. No mess at all.

Even before I used the cordless stick vacuum to clean my home, I instantly felt that my house improved a few notches by having this fancy and extra sleek all-in-one tower displayed proudly in my laundry room.  Not only does it it look beautiful, but it holds a myriad of tools and accessories that can be used to clean just about everything in your home. The suction of the vacuum is fantastic and the battery charge lasts for a very long time. An extra battery is included, but I haven't found it necessary since the charge hold is more than sufficient. The Vacuum itself is very light and it's easy to maneuver. 

All of the six tools included in the tower have come in handy, but I especially love the  mop nozzle option.  It is super easy to use and only requires water while getting your tile and hardwoods spotless!  
Another favorite feature of the LG CordZero is that the vacuum is cordless so you don't have to worry about getting tangled up in cords. Not having to constantly rearrange cords makes along with not having to find outlets to replug as you move through your home makes cleaning a lot less daunting. Lastly, the vacuum automatically clears the dust and dirt into a collection bag within the tower so you can don't have to ""clean up after you clean up""! I would definitely recommend the LG CordZero All-in-One tower to everyone, but especially for those who love to use all the latest and greatest technology and innovative products."

And on top of all that it empty’s it’s self. And it’s so easy to you and with not having a cord you get into places that don’t usually get touched all the time. Picks up dog hair great. I just love this vacuum you can just take off charger and do quick pick up.
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,"Oct 6, 2021",wocket,Love this vacuum!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my first wireless vacuum after a life of corded uprights. I can't believe how great it is - if I see dirt or a ball of dust - just grab the vacuum off the rechargeable stand, vacuum it up and return it. No more unwinding the cord, vacuuming, then winding it back up. Also - if you are used to a corded vacuum like me - this one is so light! Vacuuming stairs has never been easier (or safer in my opinion). It has a spare battery if you have a lot of cleaning to do. I have not needed it yet. The suction on it is great and it is very easy to steer around corners. A great vacuum indeed!"

I didn't expect to love it so much, but LG went above and beyond to make this easy for the buyer, and effortless for cleaning. This is likely the best purchase I've made this year."

homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,"Oct 2, 2021",NC_Ken,Wow,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It’s quiet and powerful and in a household with 2 kids and a dog, we need both. The adjustable length is huge, too, because it’s comfortable for everyone in the house to use. And can we talk about the fact that the vacuum empties itself when it’s on the charging dock? Wow. Game changer."
