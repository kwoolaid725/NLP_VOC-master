The other thing it does is sometimes leave a little line of dust/pet hair on rugs from the back edge of the roller head. There's a little strip of material like a short cloth brush on the trailing side of the roller. As you're vacuuming and pull it towards you, it apparently gathers the debris.

Clogs easily. Small debris become trapped in the dust cup inlet. Debris tend to become trapped above Kompressor™ requiring manual removal.,1,1,0,0,0,0
There's a ring inside the canister that all debris is supposed to stay below and the ring is there to help push out the debris.  The issue is pet hair constantly gets stuck above the ring and then clogs the units.  Poor design and quite annoying.,1,1,0,0,0,0
Pet hair gets stuck in the back of the canister between the plastic piece you push down to compress the dirt and the filter and there's no way to access that space besides getting a wire and fishing out the clogged hair. I've had to do this after each use. After only vacuuming 3 rooms. It's super annoying and poorly designed.,1,1,0,0,0,0
"I purchased it expecting it to be effective on pet hair. If there is any accumulation of pet hair (more than light shedding from 1-2 days), it repeatedly clogs and turns off.
