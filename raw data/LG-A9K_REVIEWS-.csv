bestbuy,LG A925KSM,5,9/7/2022 17:17,Curmudgeon1,"POWERFUL, LIGHTWEIGHT & EFFICIENT STICK VACUUM","The LG CordZero A925KSM Kompressor Stick Vacuum is similar to some other LG cordless vacuum models, and that is a very good thing.  The LG A925KSM is an excellent cordless stick vacuum that performs very well and is very pleasant and easy to use.

The LG CordZero A925KSM Kompressor arrives very well packed and includes the vacuum motor power head, an aluminum telescoping extension wand (20” collapsed, 29.5” extended), a universal power nozzle (for carpet and bare floors), a combination tool (with removable brush), a crevice tool, a free-standing / wall mountable, portable storage stand with integral battery charger, two lithium ion rechargeable batteries, a spare pre-filter for the motor and a small brush for cleaning the dirt collection canister and motor housing.

Assembly of the charging stand is straightforward, and LG provides a quantity of printed product documentation.  The stand has a weighted base, which I found to be very stable.  The stand may also be wall mounted.  The hardware for wall attachment is included.  Notably, all of the included components and accessories are accommodated on the charging stand!  

The combination tool and crevice tool attachments can be used with or without the telescoping extension wand, easily accommodating cleaning out of reach areas, as well as close-up cleaning tasks such as upholstered furniture.  The telescoping wand provides four latching positions.  All of the attachments easily snap together and latch securely.

Cordless stick vacuums are particularly attractive and desirable for their light weight, easy maneuverability and superior convenience.  The LG CordZero A925 Kompressor excels in those attributes.  

The vacuum weighs only 5.95 lbs, with most of the weight concentrated in the motor unit and battery.  The handle is large and comfortable.  The thumb operated power on/off switch and motor speed control switches (+ / -) are conveniently located and easily operated.  Switches only require momentary depression and do not need to be held continuously during operation as some stick vacuums require.

The power vacuum nozzle is equipped with a ball-gimbal mount which affords outstanding maneuverability and directional control.  The CordZero easily reaches under low furniture, and is easily maneuvered next to walls and furnishings for excellent edge cleaning.

The power vacuum nozzle contains a motorized 9” brushroll which operates at all times for both carpeted and hard surface floors.  A pair of small rollers facilitates movement on carpeting, but nevertheless, there are times when forward motion required additional physical effort.  I found that a high angle of attack exacerbated that issue, and lowering the angle of the stick vacuum reduced the level of required effort.  However, I also found that lowering the angle of attack often necessitates bending slightly to lower the handle/stick.  This created an occasional annoyance.  This issue does not result from the telescoping extension wand being too short.  Rather, it is a product of the design of the leading edge of the of the power nozzle which can embed in carpet pile.

LG provides a specification of 200 watts of suction power.  If LG is actually describing an air watts rating, 200 watts is double the required 100 air watt standard for upright vacuums, and is only slightly below the 220 air watt standard for canister vacuums.

I found the suction power to be more than adequate.  The CordZero A925 provides three motor speeds (power levels) labeled as Normal, Power and Turbo.  The default, Normal mode proved to be extremely effective on both hard and carpeted surfaces.  The Power and Turbo motor speeds reduce battery run-time and increase noise level.

LG claims 40 minutes of operation (per battery) in Normal mode, 20 minutes in Power mode and 6 minutes in Turbo mode when using the floor cleaning Universal Power Nozzle.  When used with a non-powered tool, the claimed operating times are 60 minutes in Normal mode, 30 minutes in Power mode and 7 minutes in Turbo mode.  When used with the power nozzle the claimed run times are 40 minutes in Normal mode, 20 minutes in Power mode and 6 minutes in Turbo mode.  Using two fully charged batteries provides for doubling of the foregoing operating times.  The power unit of the vacuum has an LED display with 3 incremental bars for battery capacity.  After using the LG A925 several times, we believe that with the two included batteries, whole house cleaning is well within expectations.

The lithium ion, batteries are 25.9 volt, 2.4 Ah / 62.16 Wh (2.3 Ah / 59.57 Wh minimum) capacity.  Replacement batteries are expensive so they should be properly maintained.  Battery charging is accommodated by charging one battery while attached to the vacuum motor unit as well as the second battery in the charging stand.  Batteries are not charged simultaneously;  they are charged sequentially.  The charging stand first charges the battery which is attached to the vacuum, and upon completion, then charges the second battery in the stand.  Each battery requires approximately 4 hours to fully charge (8 hours to charge both batteries).

Completion of charging of each battery is annunciated by LED indicators (3 incremental LED bars on the vacuum handle for attached battery, and a single LED on the charging stand for second battery).  Completed charging of the primary battery is also annunciated by a push-notification to the available LG Thin-Q smartphone app.  The built-in LED panel also shows the progress of charging, the need for filter cleaning, detection of a clogged vacuum flow-path and indicates if Wi-Fi is active.

I already had the Thin-Q app installed on my LG smartphone.  Nevertheless, it required a few attempts to finally connect the vacuum with the app via wi-fi.  The CordZero communicates only on 2.4GHz wi-fi.

The Thin-Q app tracks usage of the CordZero by date and cleaning sessions, reporting total hours/minutes of use.  It also displays the duration of use in each of the three power modes, and notifies the user when filters require cleaning.  Additional data granularity might be useful, such as displaying the duration of individual cleaning sessions, rather than just the grand total of each day’s use.  

The Thin-Q app displays when the battery attached to the vacuum is being charged and when it is fully charged.  It does not provide any additional battery status data such as the remaining capacity of the battery (% remaining), and when charging, the progress of the charge (% charged – time remaining to 100%).  There is no information provided for the second battery.

One improvement that I believe would be beneficial and appreciated would be the addition of an LED display (with pushbutton) on the LG batteries.  Every tool battery pack that I own has such a display.  It is very convenient to be able to simply press the button momentarily and for the approximate current remaining charge level of the battery to be instantly displayed on the LED lamps.

Air filtration is comprised of multiple filter elements and is listed as being 5 stage HEPA filtration.  The filters are removable and washable.  A spare pre-filter is also included.  

The small dust collection bin can fill quickly.  The CordZero A925 Kompressor employs a very unique lever operated “piston” to compress the dust and pet hair in the bin, thereby extending the intervals between emptying.  A single press of the release latch quickly and neatly dumps the contents of the dust bin.

I am hopeful that the CordZero A925 proves to be durable and reliable, but of course, only time will tell.  The unit is comprised of a significant quantity of plastic components.  The latch and hinge which secure the dust collection bin appear to potentially be fragile.  Nevertheless, the vacuum appears to have a high quality build, with a solid feel and well made and nicely finished components.  The LG CordZero A925 Kompressor is a high-quality stick vacuum!

Overall, the LG CordZero A925 Kompressor stick vacuum is excellent.  It is compact, lightweight, easily maneuverable, and efficient.  It is powerful, yet not unpleasantly noisy.  It is well-equipped with accessories which attach and detach with ease, and all of which have dedicated storage places on the included charging/storage stand.  The two large capacity batteries provide approximately two hours of run-time with the non-powered tools or approximately 80 minutes of operating time when used with the power nozzle, which is more than adequate for thoroughly cleaning a large house.  The vacuum cleaning power and efficiency are great.

I believe that you will be just as thoroughly pleased and satisfied with the excellent CordZero A925 Kompressor stick vacuum as we are with ours!"
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,5,9/7/2022 13:02,Pilgrim007,"Highly portable, yet powerful stick vacuum","The LG CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum is a great looking, relatively light vacuum cleaner which fits in nicely between our existing corded and robot vacuum cleaners.

Unboxing and assembly seemed to take longer than I had anticipated, as some of the references in the quick-start and instructions referred to items that were not included in my set. It appears that there are three different flavors of this vacuum and although I am happy with mine, it had references to accessories, an accessory holder and mopping ability which this one does not have. Again, not a problem as I did not get the vacuum for mopping but it was a bit confusing at first to use the one-size-fits-all instructions.

The manual advises charging the batteries before usage so I timed it and it was about an hour or so before the battery was fully charged. Once the vacuum charging mount is assembled, it provides a spot to charge the battery as well as dock the vacuum with its-on-board battery and both will charge in sequence. This means that once the primary battery runs out, you can just swap it out for the spare and then charge that one as you continue cleaning, doubling the effective running time. The vacuum itself will slide down the very top part of the mount and once settled there, it will charge the on-board battery as the other battery remains below, in its mount – very clever!

The charging mount can be free-standing or attached to a wall with the included mounting hardware. You can even dispense with the stand’s foot if you are wall mounting and don’t need to free-stand the vacuum. I am using the freestanding mount for now but will likely mount it later down the line.

The stand includes two accessory mount points which securely hold the two included tools (crevice and soft brush). It means that the accessories are not with you as you clean but they are at least in an obvious storage spot. Even some corded standing vacuums don’t have the tools on board so this is not a big deal but I occasionally see something I wish I had the tool for and then have to really want it, to stop what I am doing and head back to base for the tool.

The vacuum can join your Wi-Fi network and then the LG ThinQ app will track things like battery life, cleaning history and other interesting but not necessary data. For me, it is mostly a novelty but I do like when the app notifies me that the batteries are fully charged again.

Using the vacuum is quite liberating. After years of cleaning a 2600 square foot home with various corded vacuums, it was eye-opening to take the same route with a cordless vacuum.

With the universal floor tool attached, I found I was moving around quicker than with the corded. As the vacuum is lighter and did not have as aggressive beater bar inside the floor tool, I was concerned it wasn’t as powerful as the corded. It certainly leaves less obvious marks on the carpet but still seemed to collect the same amount of carpet fiber, pet hair and other debris. The manual had warned that the universal floor tool might be loud on hard surfaces but I did not really notice and it did fine on our mix of carpet, vinyl and laminate floor.

Being able to just keep going where I would previously have to retrace my steps, in order not to exceed the power cord length was great. In addition, the Kompressor technology helps to reduce stops and visits to empty the debris cannister in the garbage. The Kompressor really is just a push button slide that pushes hair, carpet fiber etc. down near the bottom of the cannister so you can continue vacuuming for longer. I found it did reduce stops but did not really push it to the limit, in case it reduced cleaning power. It also helped keep the cannister cleaner as debris wasn’t able to just gather at the top although it remains to be seen if that will continue to work or dust will build up near the top over time. That said, the manual said you could wash out the cannister so it may not be an issue if you keep up with maintenance.

I was able to do about three quarters of our house, including stairs, with a single battery on normal power. Occasionally I would boost the power to get something embedded in the carpet but did not need the turbo function yet. The LG documentation shows that the battery life is drastically reduced if you run it in the higher modes for too long so I was careful.

Swapping batteries was painless other than the vacuum abruptly stopping and needing to walk back to the charging station to swap them over. I then had plenty of power to return upstairs and finish the last two rooms.

The app kept track of running time and battery status as I cleaned which was interesting but not especially useful. Perhaps over time it could be but the jury is still out for me on the app right now. At worst, it might be helpful when it comes time to replace some of the consumable parts like filters and batteries, which LG warns will wear out and need to be replaced at some point.

In summary, I am very happy with the portability and power of this vacuum and it seemed to be on par with the bigger, heavier corded vacuum we own. It could be run as a stick vacuum or you could remove the stick part and use it to clean stairs or inside a car, with lots of power and even more portability to get in smaller spaces. The battery life is good enough to clean a fairly large house, especially as it comes with two batteries and one can always be on charge. The Kompressor tech is useful but not especially glamorous – still makes it better than most cannisters in terms of keeping them clean and how often they need emptying before they affect the cyclone effect. 

Great job LG!"
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,5,9/7/2022 16:19,MrGadget,LG CordZero A925KSM Cordless Stick Is A STANDOUT,"This LG Cord Zero cordless stick vacuum with Kompressor technology comes with two batteries for extended run time and a clever dirt squisher.

Kompressor technology is a clever built-in feature that compresses the dirt in the dust bin so it does not need to be emptied as often. Moving a lever is all it takes to squish the bin contents.

Get up to 120 minutes of uninterrupted performance with a pair of included batteries. These batteries are said to be an upgraded lithium-ion design that can take repeated charges and discharges and come back for more.

A portable charging stand is provided that holds the CordZero in place and does not require holes to be drilled into a wall, though wall mounting is an option.

One-touch controls turn the vacuum on and off and adjust power levels up to Turbo mode with just a thumb. This should prove to be less strenuous on the hand.

Telescope the wand for greater flexibility and to more conveniently store the unit away while taking up less space.

Removable and washable filters extend the life of the vacuum. In addition, the cyclone system is removable and washable.

A Smart Inverter Motor creates powerful suction and is backed by a 10-year limited warranty (the motor, not the batteries).

The ThinQ app for iOS and Android allows users to check on the vacuum’s cleaning history and perform product diagnostics.

Convertible from a stick to a hand vac, clean floors, furniture and vehicle interiors. Use the included Universal Power Nozzle when in hand vac mode.

LG CordZero is recommended for homes with minimal carpeting or rugs. It is not recommended for use on any fiber floor covering with medium to deep pile, the same as for any vacuum with a spinning brush head.

**WHAT’S IN THE BOX**

• A925KSM CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum (Six pounds w/o accessories)
• Telescoping wand
• Universal Power Nozzle
• 2 Quick Release Batteries
• Portable Charging Station
• Crevice Tool
• Extra Pre-filter
• AC Power Adapter

**THE SETUP**

Manuals read, BOTH batteries charged (can take up to 240 minutes from fully discharged), it’s time to . . .

**PUT IT TO THE TEST**

A strong, not too loud, motor whir tells me this stick means business.There is plenty of suction even on the lowest power setting. Once it hits a low-pile rug, the power level should be increased for effectiveness, which it to be expected. 

The Kompressor lever is a novel gimmick and it works. As the bin fills, the contents tend to coalesce near the cyclonic ports. Using the Kompressor lever allows the dirt, dust and other debris to be compressed and directed to the bottom of the bin so it does not appear to require emptying so frequently. Who thought of this clever idea?

Battery performance has been as expected, with both batteries providing enough power to clean everywhere. I like the ease-of-use when vacuuming inside our cars. 

Easy to empty, and the simple, washable filter is very effective. There are no consumables to deal with on a regular basis, though the filters will degrade over time. The batteries will eventually need to be replaced. Of equal importance is that the design does not create the need for unusual and unplanned deep cleaning of the CordZero itself.

The brush head is easy to dismantle for removal of anything wrapped around the brush. A quarter-turn of the red screw on the bottom releases the cover for brush head access.

There have been no clogs to remove.

The Wi-Fi-enabled ThinQ App’s monitoring shows a detailed cleaning history and other stats but is, in my mind, a feature that is not so important or relevant to this reviewer.

Everyone here is pretty impressed with this LG CordZero.

**CONCLUSION**

Easy to set up. Easy to use. Easy to like, even love. Very easy to recommend.

**WARRANTY**

Manufacturer’s one year warranty from the date of the original purchase, and 10 years on the Smart Inverter Motor"
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,5,9/9/2022 20:10,TechGeek,Powerful compact stick vacuum!,"Compact, bagless, super light and yet a powerful stick vacuum with tons of features. It came with an extra battery and an extra pre-filter along with a combination and crevice tool. The first thing I noticed on this superlight stick vacuum is the adjustable or telescopic wand and the Kompressor lever. The standalone charging base has an option to charge the second battery. The batteries themselves are compact and each battery is good for 60 min operation.  
	
Design:
	Small form factor with a base station to charge the stick vacuum and the additional battery. The charging station or the base is heavy enough to hold the stick vacuum in place and I didn't have to worry about drilling holes in the walls to keep it secure. It does come with a wall mount option as well. I like the telescopic wand, lets me get under the furniture and everyone in my house including the kids can use it. The best part is the Kompressor lever that really compresses the dirt and keeps the filter free of debris. It will be a while before I have to empty the bin. It also helps clean the bin and not have to worry about getting your fingers in to pull the debris out- good thinking LG! The filters can be removed easily and washed in the sink. The best part is the roller or the brush head that can be easily removed by just twisting one end, and it slides right out. The roller has minimalist design, can twist, and turn easily to go around the corners and is powerful enough to pick up fine debris, and they are so easy to clean! The cyclone head slides right out as well and can be easily cleaned and washed in the sink. I started using this vacuum over other cordless ones that I have, just because of its design and the ease with which it can be cleaned. All the controls on the vacuum can be easily accessed with your thumb. I downloaded the LG ThinQ app to monitor its usage and diagnose issues right on the phone. I like the turbo mode option, gives me the ability to crank up the suction power to deep clean my rugs! I noticed the battery life reduce quite a bit (think about 20 mins) when I had the turbo mode on. The vacuum has three suction levels - normal, power, and turbo. The turbo mode definitely does get the job done when it comes to picking up fine dust. 
	
Function:
	Coming to the suction power, I was impressed on how good it was it in picking up the fine dust from the rugs.  The five-stage filtration system speaks for itself when you see the bin filled with fine dust! I live in a dry state and dust accumulation is a major problem and I can see using this vacuum every other day. It worked great on carpet and on hardwood floors and my only complaint was it has a small opening in the front, and it struggles to pick up large debris on the hardwood floors. 
	
	Overall, I highly recommend this powerful vacuum just for the fact it has good suction power and ease of maintenance. It literally took me less than 10 minutes to clean the filter and the cyclone head, empty the dust bin, and clean the debris off the roller. It’s a little expensive but is comparable to the name brand ones on the suction power, but definitely beats the rest on ease of maintenance. I had it for over 2 weeks and used it every other day and happy with its suction power and battery life!"
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,5,9/7/2022 13:38,DeeGore,Nice experience!,"I have several vacuum cleaners, even though I don’t really enjoy vacuuming. I like the end result, but the actual process of vacuuming is a chore. I have never used a cordless stick vacuum like this LG one though. This vacuum is pretty quiet, which is saying a lot since I think most vacuum cleaners are loud as heck. And the air that blows out when I use it isn’t hot air. That is one of the big negatives about my standard stand up vac. I get so hot and sweaty whenever I use it, not just from pushing it around but the hot air that blows on me the whole time. This one is so effortless, it’s weird. I actually enjoy using it.

This LG came with a wall-mount stand for the vac, but at this point, I’m not going to be installing that permanently on my wall somewhere. I have shared a picture of how to charge this vac if you chose to go unmounted like me. This vac came with a regular nozzle, combination tool, crevice tool and a cleaning brush. The cleaning brush is a nice touch because I really can get up and in the dirt cup with it to dislodge some of the hair that doesn’t want to fall out when I open the latch. It also came with an extra prefilter, which is nice. That has to be washed once in a while so it can be switched out and you can keep on vacuuming while one is hanging to dry. This vac comes with two batteries, so you can always have a backup. This vac comes with a nice maintenance guide which feels like a plastic sheet. It has a little suction cup so you can stick it somewhere to be able to reference as needed. There are several things you can do to keep this vac stick in good operating mode, so this is a good tool to remind you. I myself find it very satisfying to pop open the dirt cup and dump it into the trash can. 

I really like this stick vac to suck up the hair on my bathroom floor. With my regular push vac, it always sucks up the rugs that I have in there and it’s a pain. With this stick I just sweep with it and my rugs don’t get disturbed. There is a turbo power button for extra vacuum power. I use that when I can but definitely do just fine with regular mode on the tile floor. If I had just hard surface floors I could see just owning this vac stick. It’s so easy to use. The extension pipe that connects the nozzle to the vac unit can be used with the other tools, and it extends. If you are short or tall it can be adjusted to your liking. This is also very good for vacuuming up at the ceiling level, etc. It is very nice to be cordless. This is also nice for left handed users. Half of my family is left handed, but not me. I pay a lot of attention to how right handed everything is, and since this is cordless, it’s going to be easier to use with either hand.

I connected this to my LG ThinQ app, it wasn’t too difficult. I already had the app because I have an LG smart TV, but for some reason, that isn’t on the app anymore and I couldn’t reconnect it. I’ll work on that later. Why connect a vacuum cleaner to a smart app? Well, it lets me know when my battery is finished charging. That’s actually very nice. It also tells me how many times someone has used the vac, and for how long. So if you want to keep tabs on that, here you go.  Multiple people can share this info, they can all download the app."
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,4,9/8/2022 10:02,AtlantaGreg,A handy manageably-sized vacuum,"The LG A9 CordZero is the latest in LG’s stick vacuum cleaner models.  I have one of the earliest versions and for the most part was happy with it, but there were a couple of buggy things I didn’t like and this one seems to have cleared those up. The CordZero comes with several accessories and mine came with the main vacuum head (10.2 inches wide) with extension pipe, a second battery, a spare air filter (one is already inserted), a crevice tool and another with a brush, along with a cleaning brush to help clean the canister out.  A stand is also included which is very handy as you can set the main container unit in it to charge the battery and hold it.  I use mine on it’s included stand on the floor, but you can mount it on the wall if you prefer. 

The CordZero is smaller compared to some other stick vacuums, so has a smaller dirt container on it.  My older model would get easily clogged with dirt and frankly was a little bit of a pain to clean out.  The newer A9 model has a lever which they call a Kompressor lever, and you just slide it down a couple of times when emptying the bin, and it forces anything stuck in the upper area out – MUCH easier than before.  Being smaller makes it easier to handle as it doesn’t weight much, and the main head swivels and pivots easily around furniture and gets into smaller areas.  Unfortunately, there is no LED light on it to light up your path, though.  It will let you know when the air filter needs to be changed, but they last a good while.  The roller in the main vacuum head slides out for cleaning as well.

You have three levels of power (normal, power, and turbo), so your battery life will vary depending on what you use.  Normal can get you from 40-60 minutes, but I find this is best for just light duty work.  Power mode is noticeably stronger, and you’ll get from 20-30 minutes per charge on that setting.  The Turbo mode is the strongest and works the best, but you’ll drain the battery in just 6-7 minutes using this.  Having the second battery is essential for this machine, but since the stand can charge both of them at the same time, you’ll be topped off when you need to use it.  Again, I find the Power mode to be the sweet spot of good cleaning power and battery power.  The handle is easy to hold, and the buttons easy to reach while using it (via your thumb).  At only just over 10 inches, the main vacuum head won’t cover huge areas per swath, so if you have HUGE rooms and a lot of them, you might need to look for a larger model, but for many, this one and the two batteries should work. And note – this is NOT for wet vacuuming – just dry dirt, dust, hair, etc.

You can download the “LG ThinQ” app from Apple or Google with this model, and it will connect via WiFi to the vacuum (2.4 Ghz only), so after creating an account with it and picking the item you have, you can monitor how often you’ve cleaned it, if the filter is getting clogged up, or run diagnostics should you feel there is an issue.  Handy to have to monitor the status of the vacuum and easy enough to navigate through once you get it installed, though it was a bit buggy and unnecessarily fiddly to get connected and working initially for me (eventually it kicked in, though).

Overall I really like this updated model.  It works as well or slightly better than the original, the Kompressor lever makes cleaning it out much easier, and the size is perfect for many.  My only complaint that remains with this one is that the main cleaning head isn’t so great with certain larger items (hair if you get an indoor haircut, nuts, etc), so you have to slightly lift up the head and pull it backward over those items to catch them.  Not a game changer, but something to be aware of. Other than that, it works very well on my carpet and hardwood.  Look for sale prices but most of these aren’t inexpensive, but it’s worth it for what you get."
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,5,9/8/2022 18:14,MarkusKong,Amazing Cordless Vacuum w/ Swappable Battery!,"Looking for a powerful cordless stick vacuum with the ability to hot swap batteries to complete the necessary cleaning job? The LG CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum with Kompressor technology has you covered ladies and gentlemen.

I personally own a Dyson Cyclone V10 which technically is 4 years or so old now and I remember when I first got it; the one thing I had an issue with the most was the battery life. I would have it on high and it would last maybe 20 minutes or so. So I had to sacrifice the suction power to make the battery last a bit longer. Well, with the LG CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum with Kompressor technology I can get a solid 2 hours or so thanks to LG for including an additional battery. So while using one of the batteries you can have the other one charging.

I really enjoyed the usability and comfortability of the LG CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum with Kompressor technology. Instead of having to constantly hold down a trigger to operate this vacuum; it has a one touch control so that you can literally just touch it with your finger to start it and touch it again to stop it. When it comes to the suction power on my hard floors; it really does an amazing job with picking up dust and hair. I also like that I can use different attachments for the cleaning job so if I need to make the LG CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum with Kompressor technology more portable for lets say vacuuming my car; I have that option.  You may think that the dust compartment is small but thanks to the Kompressor technology that LG is using; the dust is compacted so that you can complete your cleaning job before having to empty the bin. Once the cleaning job is complete you’re probably wondering what about maintenance right? Well, LG has graciously provided the ability to remove the filters and wash them.

Overall I must say that I am really happy with the LG CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum with Kompressor technology. Now I have the ability to do an amazing vacuuming job for 2 hours and don’t have to always worry about going to empty the dustbin all at the same time."
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,4,9/9/2022 19:06,hahanson,There's a Lot To Love,"We have a travel trailer we rent out during the summers, so once a week we are always cleaning, readying the trailer for the next rental. I have to admit the Dyson V8 we've had for a couple of years has been a godsend. It's light, easy to maneuver, and very powerful -- and cordless. Overlooking the fact that the battery only lasted about 8 min on maximum power, it was perfect. There was nothing else that compared. Until now.

After spending some time with the LG - CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum with Kompressor technology, I think it’s perfect for anyone who wants a premium cordless vacuum that has an awesome charging stand, excellent dirt pickup, and the convenience of an easily replaceable battery to make quick work of any cleaning.

I have to admit the Dyson seems to have more powerful suction, but the LG does almost as well while offering conveniences the Dyson simply can't. The stand can go anywhere (you don't have to drill it into a wall), and charges the CordZero when placed in the stand. The stand also has an additional charging station for the included spare battery. Should the CordZero run out of juice while you're cleaning, simply detach the battery and swap in the fully charged one and continue with what you're doing. No waiting forever while the battery charges. Run time on max power was better than expected at 15 minutes per battery, giving 30 min at max, and almost 2 hours on the standard power setting. The stand also served as storage for the brush and crevice attachments.

The Kompressor is a terrific feature that allows you to press down on a button to compact dust, dirt and other debris in the storage container. It also makes it easier when emptying into the garbage. The CordZero came with 3 washable filters.

Overall, the CordZero A9 offers a lot of value, despite its premium-level cost. The CordZero is solidly constructed and cleans incredibly well. While it has a lot of things going for it, what really stands out for me is the self-standing dock, which, in my opinion, is the best I've come across and is incredibly versatile as it is portable, holds additional attachments, and allows me to charge two batteries simultaneously."
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,5,9/7/2022 19:14,bckrupps37,Love having 2 removable batteries,"Pros:
-Good power on normal mode (no need to stress the battery life)
-Nice and quiet even on turbo mode
-Includes a spare filter
-Filters are washable
-There are multiple ways to configure the charging stand including strong hidden sticky pads so you don’t have to drill into the wall (The stand without the additional mount was fine for me)
-You can charge both batteries at one time on the charging stand
-The charging stand holds almost all of its attachments
-on/off button on the handle. (Trigger buttons are not fun)
-Adjustable telescopic handle is great for taller people like me that are 6’2”

Cons:
-The dust bin is not that large although the emptying lever is great
-I wish the powered mop attachment could be bought separately in the USA because I would buy it right away.


The best cordless vacuum on the market based on the removable batteries, runtime and the better build quality and features vs competitors. It’s great for hardwood, rugs and getting under the beds and furniture wasn’t a problem either."
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,5,9/30/2022 15:46,TanyaT,"Best vacuum I have purchased, ever!","I have always had issues with having to empty the bin on my previous Dysons, and that was my main peeve with those vacuums.  I have a disability, so I don’t vacuum as often as I would like, so there is more lint, dust, etc., when I do, hence I am constantly emptying the bin because Dysons can barely hold anything. My last one accidentally sucked up a small stick my dog tracked in from the backyard that blended in with the hardwood floor, and it punctured the interior of the filter, and basically ruined my last Dyson, as it never worked right since. 

But with this machine, I can vacuum as much as I want, and with a push of a button, it just compacts everything and makes more room. For the price, there is nothing better for bin space, and with the backup battery, I can do the whole house with no issues (something I also couldn’t do with a Dyson).

This was the best investment, period. Especially if you can grab it on sale with a 0% finance deal."

* The stand works out very well as we can keep it conveniently at any place that we want.
* Our kitchen floor is tiled, and it helps keep the surface free of solid food pieces from peanuts to rice to cookie crumbs,..
* I use it to clean the rug in the formal dining room and in our living room. It does clean the carpets well; however, I felt it having a little difficulty (it can be easily overcome by adjusting the angle of attack) to easily move forward on certain carpet types.
* it does well on the remaining hardwood floor we have and also nice with getting rid of little indoor spider webs on curtains and all nooks and corners.
* This vacuum cleaner is light and handy, and it makes cleaning fun and easy."

Mainly because emptying the dustbin is too long of a process which creates a mess and leaves you w/o a vacuum for 24hrs while the filter dries. Otherwise, I do like the maneuverability but it does take multiple times for it to pick up some of the slightly bigger pieces on my hardwood floors. Haven't used it on the carpet to review that."
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,4,9/19/2022 11:23,KansasMeddlingMom,"Great Machine Experience, Awful App Experience","I received the LG - CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum with Kompressor, model A925KSM in a huge box with lots of parts that needed to be put together. First, the construction of the actual vacuum, including the telescopic wand is no problem. Then you must put together the charging stand and thread the charging cord through the back of that said stand. That takes a little bit of nimbleness, but not too bad otherwise.

First the good. I have the stand stored in a utility-type closet that has an outlet to plug into, nice way to keep it out of the way and my area clutter-free. So, like other cordless stick vacuums, the motor assembly clicks into the telescoping wand and  makes the unit top heavy and unable to stand on its own unless you lean it against something. This configuration has 2 batteries that are chargeable at the same time, so there should be no reason that you can not be able to get a nice, long vacuuming time no matter how large an area you may need to do. I am not sensitive to noise, but my husband is and he even commented on how quiet the motor was on the highest turbo level setting. I personally love the telescoping wand because it allows for comfort, no matter how short or tall the person vacuuming is. By the way, the wand must be at its shortest length when you click it on the charging stand, you will hear a tinkling sound that lets you know that you have properly attached the vacuum unit to the stand and the battery indicator on the front of the unit will have lines going up the shape of the battery.

In 2019 I got the prior model to this one, the paperwork and brochure that I received at the time called it the A9. The Kompressor is a welcome new addition. If you look at the picture I have included, it is the red push rod that helps push out the dirt and other contents of the collection bin when you open the door or flap to that container. One of my chief complaints, and there must have been many others that felt this way, was that when you opened the dust bin, the filter unit always came loose and you needed either your hands or something else to grab the dirt in the bin. Well, this has now been remedied.

Now the bad and the ugly. I was having a terrible time getting my unit to connect with the app through the WiFi, etc. I have an android phone and I downloaded the LG Thin app. You use this app to register the unit's warranty and add the device, through your WiFi, whether that be a home or office. The instructions specifically state that you cannot use either the WiFi setting, but your location's network and that also cannot be a 5G frequency, but must use a 2.4 GHZ one. I have encountered that before and have the option to set my network on that setting. The instructions also state that you should physically be near your router with the vacuum and your phone, too. While I did that, I found it ridiculous that with my strength of router plus extender on the second floor that I would have to do this. However, I tried at several different times and places to no avail to get this linked and I knew that this aspect was one of the items that LG wanted commentary on.    

Good thing that the 800# is open 24/7. I called over the weekend when I had more time and ran into a terrible experience. First, they offshore you to the Philippines and my customer service person, Kristine, did not speak English like an American does. So, not only did I find it difficult to understand her, I requested that she slow down and spell some of her words because I did not understand what she was saying. I wound up asking her to let me talk several times. Usually at the beginning of a customer service troubleshoot phone call, the operator asks for various set up information, which she never did, and they also ask for the model number so they can reference instructions for that specific unit. I told her my problem and had to stop her and say that ""Don't you need the model number."" Bottom line, it was very obvious that she was not trained to be able to troubleshoot on this machine and certainly could not communicate with me. She gave me the phone number for the app department, not a toll free call, by the way. I spent 60 minutes on the phone with her to no resolve.

While I was waiting on the phone during the many times that she put me on hold, I though what if I delete the device and then try to add it again. I did this 5 times until it finally worked after I got off the phone. The really bad and ugly part is that I did nothing different all these times until it finally worked. I had added it the very 1st time, but it was offline and never connected. After 7-10 times of adding and deleting, it worked. As I write this review, 1 day later, the unit is still connected to the app. After trying everything I knew to do and getting the unit to connect with the app through WiFi, I put it back on the charging stand and have opened up the app, from time to time, and checked on the status, to see if it is still connected.This app uses GPS to identify where the LG item is physically located and it states the status of the machine. So, right now it states that the unit is ""Fully Charged..."" So, it let me know when it was charging and even sent a notification when it was fully charged. I thank goodness that all of this finally worked out, but in my case it took way too much time, energy, and effort, and when I reached out to the supposed experts at customer service, that went no where, too. By the way, when the machine is not on, you can use the Smart Diagnose button , follow it through to do a product check. In my case,, it did not detect abnormal operation, checking the suction motor, filter and whether the filter needs cleaning, the battery, and if there is any restrained spinning. It dates and time stamps the diagnosis along with general maintenance tips  

The good is the machine, its operation, and cleaning tools plus replacement parts included, the bad-what is up with the app??? In conclusion, I took 1 star away from my review and even considered taking 2 away. As a consumer, you need to evaluate what is most important to you."
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,5,9/15/2022 18:32,bd43274,well designed and thought out offering from LG,"I'll preface this by saying this review doesn't live in a ""vacuum"", pun intended. I have had a few of these stick vacuums over the years, and they've mostly been the same brand, probably the most popular brand in the category. That being said, that manufacturer should be paying attention, this LG is a more than worthy competitor, and is better in some ways that may just prove to be the tipping point for many consumers in the market for one and doing a direct comparison. As such, most of my review points are going to be a bit of a direct comparison to the LG's more expensive competitor.

pros:

	- build quality - Better build quality than what I'm used to. The components feel sturdy and well made, certainly well thought out and engineered. It's very obvious that the team at LG saw something on the market and didn't seek to reinvent the wheel, only to make it better.

	- adjustable height - How novel, a telescoping main tube that you can slide back and forth, depending on your height and comfort level?

	- ""kompressor""/filter clear switch - This is a really cool feature. Use this external switch to push an internal ring down inside the filter, sort of tamping down the contents. Helps to clear the suction area and to create create more capacity. Akin to pushing down the trash when it gets full so you can fit more in, only significantly less gross since here your hands don't get dirty.

	- floor stand - Also a nice touch, the included floor stand let's you have a bit more freedom over where the vacuum is stored, though it is still attached via power cable. Nice to not have to drill into the wall unless you actually want to though.

	- button operation (instead of trigger) - Not the biggest of ""pros"" of course, but operating via button (including multiple levels of suction per press) instead of a trigger. 

	- 2 batteries included, removable - Another win for this model in my opinion is the inclusion of 2 *removable* batteries, and the ability to charge both at the same time - one in the vacuum itself and the other cleverly tucked away in the stand. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 hours on the lowest setting and 15 minutes on the highest, it's very easy to switch to the other battery to keep things moving (and continue to charge the other battery without missing a beat!)

	- suction - All other technology aside, it actually does a fairly good job of cleaning both carpets and hard floors. It is, however, still a stick vacuum, and while good for day to day cleaning, probably not the deepest clean you'll get. Larger pieces of mess (we have birds at home that make massive messes with seemingly entire giant pieces of nut/seed/what have you) aren't always picked up on the first pass.
	



cons:
	- no smaller hand held roller at this price point - While it is cheaper than some other manufacturers, I still would've like to have had the smaller roller brush, for pet hair on couches and similar messes.



misc:
	- wifi/app connection - I'm not sure how useful this will be, but there is the ability to connect via WIFI and get the ""status"" as well as cleaning log. Probably not something I'll use a ton.


overall:
	There are quite a few options out there in this category, but this is definitely one of the stronger ones. Easy 5 stars for me."
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,5,9/7/2022 22:30,skylog,Great performance/design. Versatile. Great to use.,"To sum it up, I really like this vacuum. There was definitely some thought put into the design, it works very well, it is versatile, and using it seems less of a chore than other vacuums I have used in the past.

Unboxing and setup are what you would expect, nothing out of the ordinary. Simple, quick, and straightforward. I needed to get the batteries charged up, but I was otherwise ready to go in no time. I did also spend some time installing the suggested App. You can see battery levels, some other usage data that frankly, I am not sure I am interested in, and some diagnostic stuff that may prove useful. I will have to see over time. Probably worth the install.

As for the vacuum itself, it has the same quality I have seen in other LG products I have used. Everything is solidly built and put together well. That said, I was kind of pleasantly surprised with how lightweight it was in hand. A big change from the “ancient” standard corded vacuum I have been using. It is very strange for me. I also really like the “controls.” Easy power on and off, levels, and power mode. Simple. Convenient. Comfortable (no trigger thankfully).

You get a rather nice stand/mount that I am still trying to determine how I want to set up. Once I decide on a location, I will probably go with the wall option. I really like this part of the whole package. It more or less mostly holds everything. Vacuum, batteries (yes, you get two), and attachments/tools. It is a pretty clean setup, charges the batteries, and it is great to have it all just “there.” One of my favorite parts of this package.

In use, I have found the vacuum very effective. Now, my space is rather small, but it is mix of hard flooring and carpet. It handles everything, easily. It has enough power for me in just the normal mode, which really helps with the battery, but the turbo mode works scary good. Now, it is pretty loud, but if only needed in short bursts, it is a non-issue. Perhaps if you need to use it a lot, it is something to think about. One thing I have really also liked is being able to quickly just detach and have a hand vacuum. This is something I have lacked, and it has been very useful. All in all, I have zero complaints about how it, well, just vacuums. It has been great for me. It works, it is easy to maneuver around, and can be used in several different ways.

I will also add, that while I am somewhat new to stick and honestly, nice vacuums, I also didn’t really have an issue with the size of the “bin.” It is quite a bit smaller than I am used to, but you can actually compress the contents down, giving you more room. Again, my space is small, so this wasn’t really an issue for me, but it is a nice feature, and really just kind of cool. Regardless, emptying the bin is an easy and clean process.

Given my space, this is, again, not a big deal for me in terms of getting my vacuuming jobs done, but I have to commend LG on providing two batteries with this vacuum (and the great charging solution). Per the stated ratings, admittedly in perfect conditions, you should get about an hour per battery. So, things like using some attachments will drain a little faster and using Turbo mode will drain a lot faster…but being able to use one battery and then just swap in the other is just a fantastic add. Those with large spaces and/or big jobs should be covered. I just wish more companies and sectors thought like this.

Ultimately, I really like this vacuum. It does all I need it to, and it does it well. It has an excellent storage solution, and “range” is not a concern. It’s built well, and I think it should last over time, which I think is important with something like a vacuum, but perhaps most importantly, it is just easy to use, and it simply makes my vacuuming experience better."
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,5,9/11/2022 17:38,PsykoPup,Very Nice Stick Vac,"LG has created another great product. I already own an LG TV, as well as a washer and dryer. Consequently, I’ve already been using LG’s ThinQ app (for Android). Adding this stick vac to my WiFi and the app was very easy by just following the instructions in the app. One thing I feel is missing from the app is the ability to see a numerical representation of the amount of charge the battery has. In other words, I think it should show the battery level percentage. I only noticed this was missing when I wanted to see how much battery I used during one of my vacuuming sessions. I receive notifications from the app when the battery is fully charged. The app works well, but I honestly don’t see it as necessary. I don’t foresee needing to look up my vacuuming history or need to be “told” when the battery is done charging. Maybe if there is an issue with the vacuum would it then prove to be useful.

That being said, the vacuum works wonderfully. It’s very easy the switch between the included tools and I really like how it comes with an adjustable telescopic wand. I’ve owned quite a few stick vacs and this is the first one that comes with a wand like that. Other than the wand, the other tool that I use a lot is the crevice tool. We have a Golden Retriever and his long, feathery hair is all over our floors. With past stick vacs, when I try to vacuum up his hair, the vent on the vacuum inevitably ends up blowing his hair away. It’s actually quite frustrating. With this LG stick vac, that does not happen and it’s very appreciated.

One thing I found a bit wonky is how the crevice and combination tools are stored on the stand. As I mentioned, I use crevice tool a lot. On the stand, there are 2 spots for storing the tools. The front spot is for the combination tool, and the cleaning brush is stored up inside it. The back spot is for the crevice tool. Each tool snaps into the spots and there is a release button to remove the tool. The release buttons face the front. I’m detailing this to convey the fact that pressing the release button to remove the crevice tool is somewhat difficult. There is not much space to get your finger in there to press the button. It would have been better to place the release button, at least for the crevice tool, on the side so it would be easier to get to.

We have a 3100 sq.ft. home, with hard wood floors, rugs and carpet. I’ve been able to vacuum the entire house on a single charge. On the hard wood floors and rugs I use the standard power level; on the carpets I kick in the turbo mode. A single full charge of the battery was able to handle all that without running out of juice. Very impressive. If by chance the battery does not last for a vacuuming session, there is a backup battery that was included. It’s stored away in the included charging stand ready for use. 

One unique feature of this vacuum is the “Kompressor technology”. While this is a great feature, I would not label it as “technology”. It should be called a “Kompressor button” because that’s exactly what it is. When the container gets full, you manually push down this button to compact down the debris, so more can fit in. Again, a very handy feature, but the name hints that it’s an electronic or automatic function.

All in all, this is a great vacuum. It has a very long battery life, with an extra battery to spare. It does a very good job vacuuming on hard flooring as well as rugs and carpets. There are a few “quirks” but I would definitely recommend this vacuum."
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,5,9/7/2022 14:58,Mizshutterbug,THE LG CORDZERO CORDLESS A9 IS GREAT!,"Received the LG A9 and it was a fairly easy assembly out of the box. You simply do 2 clicks and then insert the battery on the vacuum itself. A detailed instruction sheet is included showing you how to access the LG ThinQ app. I signed up with the app and registered it. You click on ADD A DEVICE and place the product information in there. Please note that this app has to be used on a 2.4 GHz network and will not work on 5GHz. For me personally I do not have an automatic switching router so I decided that after the initial run I wasn't going to be changing out my router settings as you don't need the app to run your vacuum. The app basically tells you battery life, cleaning history, filter info, etc. but I can also look at the vacuum and see the same. It IS a convenient feature if you have an easy router change up. It works splendidly without the app however and I am pleased with that.

My model came with charging stand, 2 battery packs, a crevice tool, soft brush tool and a cleaning brush tool for the bin. It has the Universal Nozzle power head which was fine for all my needs here. I charged it overnight but have since only had to charge it a couple hours for the battery to be ready again. It's quite nice to have that second battery ready if needed but I haven't had to use it. I clean my 3,000 sq. foot  house using the Normal mode and one charged battery lasts. I do not use the Turbo or Power Modes as my floors are mostly laminate with 3 rooms of carpet and I found the vacuum was more than adequate in Normal. I did try Turbo and Power modes out briefly but the noise level is pretty loud so with my sensitive ears I found the Normal perfect. You can use the included charging station free standing or they include mounting hardware for attaching to a wall. They also give you an extra washable filter, which is nice. 

I love the fact this can become a portable handheld unit by just removing it from the stick. It worked wonders on my carpeted steps heading down in the basement. I had been thinking about buying a handheld for that so it was certainly a real plus to have this feature. 

As far as the battery running times LG says you will get about an hour of cleaning time in the Normal mode, which I did. If you choose the Power Mode it should last about 20-30 minutes and the Turbo mode drops you down to 6 or 7 minutes. Of course you do have that extra battery waiting but as mentioned the Normal mode is perfect for my needs. 

After cleaning the dust bin will need to be emptied of course and it's so simple and efficient! You just push down on the Kompressor lever and everything easily comes out. No more using my hand to grab stuck remaining dust out of the bin! During use you can also compact the dust by sliding the lever down several times. On my older stick vacuum I had to empty that bin about 3 times so this was another feature I really enjoyed on the LG. The cleaning brush that's included you'll want to use around the Kompressor plate to clear away debris. I always clean out the dust bin after every use to keep the suction at its highest level. Be sure after you wash the filters they are completely dry before inserting back. LG suggests waiting 24 hours so they are not damp in any way.

All in all I found this vacuum to be an excellent choice from ease of use to its cleaning ability. I like that fact it's not too heavy or bulky and has convenience features I really like. I can definitely say I'd recommend it if you don't mind not accessing the app if you just have a 5 GHz network available. As stated, it works perfectly fine with or without the app in my opinion and makes for a most easy cleaning experience. Fantastic design job on this vacuum LG! I love mine!"
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,4,9/7/2022 17:40,FlyingC,"Not perfect, but pretty great","I have an earlier model of the LG CordZero that I've been very happy with, and this new one so far is just as good. There are a ton of things I like about it and only a few things that aren't perfect, but it's still my go-to vacuum for quick clean ups around the house. 

The charging base is sturdy and makes it really easy to grab the vacuum for use and drop it back in the slot for charging when it's done. I rarely have to switch to the second battery, but if needed it's right there in the stand always charged and ready to go. The run time I get out of a single battery is usually more than enough for me to hit the main areas in my downstairs (at least 15-20 minutes). I also like that the stand has a place to keep both attachments so they don't get lost. When I grab the vacuum to go, I usually pull the crevice tool off and slip it into my back pocket so I have it when needed.

The telescoping floor brush is another super convenient feature. I'm over 6' but when it's fully extended I can vacuum without having to stoop over. Then, when I'm doing the stairs, I can shorten it until it's just the right length to clean the steps as I go up. I can switch out the roller head with the crevice tool to get the edges of the steps, as the roller doesn't get all the way to the edges most of the time.

The ""kompressor"" technology is also a game changer. The weak link with most stick vacuums in my house is they fill up really fast with pet hair and I feel like I'm constantly emptying them. With this one, I can shut it off for a second, push the lever down to compress all the hair/debris to the bottom of the canister and then start vacuuming again. I can now do large areas without having to stop and make a trip to the trash can to empty it out. Anything that saves time is a big plus in my book.

It's easy to empty out when you're done. Usually pressing the lever down will make everything drop out, but a couple taps on the side of the trash can will get anything that tries to stick. I also pull the filter out of the top each time and tap it into the trash to clear most of the dust off. Then every few weeks I'll wash that filter and let it dry for a day and it's practically as good as new. 

It does have a wifi connection so you can add it to your LG ThinQ app with other LG appliances, but I haven't found that to be particularly useful for anything. After I'm done using it and put it on the charger, I'll get an alert later that it's finished charging. I guess that's nice, but really isn't necessary. Maybe it'll alert on other conditions if something happens to it, but I have yet to run into that situation.

There are a couple of things about it that aren't perfect. One is the suction is a little on the weak side, especially if you have the stick extended all the way. I find myself using it in the ""turbo"" mode most of the time and then it picks everything up. It's noisier and uses more battery in that mode, but still acceptable. The other thing it does is sometimes leave a little line of dust/pet hair on rugs from the back edge of the roller head. There's a little strip of material like a short cloth brush on the trailing side of the roller. As you're vacuuming and pull it towards you, it apparently gathers the debris. Then when you roll forward again it leaves the line of dust/hair on the rug. The solution for me is to always vacuum rugs by working your way backwards. Then at the end you can clean up that little line of debris. 

So, it's not perfect but like I said it's still my vacuum of choice for cleanups in between major vacuuming with a corded model. It's light, easy to use, holds a lot of debris, and has a good long battery life. For me, that overcomes its weaknesses."
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,5,9/11/2022 8:37,Alex,"Excellent stick vacuum, with some sneaky features","Here is yet another stick vacuum on the market; however, hold on for a second....this one has some things going for it.

What's in the box:  Surprisingly, a lot.  The box is fairly small, but whomever was in charge of packing the box obviously is a world champion Tetris player.  I mean this in a good way since there are quite a few things included.  Two batteries, charging stand, brush head, and two crevice cleaners are included.

Setup:  Although there are quite a few parts, setup was fairly straightforward.  You click together the stand, click together the vacuum and insert the battery(s).  You can then set up wifi, if you want, to get a few more features.....most of which I don't use...more on that.

Use:  Overall it is fairly straight forward...it is just a stick vacuum after all.  There are a few things, though, that I really like.  One of those things is the two batteries.  If you really want to get your clean on, you simply swap batteries when the first one dies.  The second battery charges in its own spot on the charging stand, so both are always charged.  I will say, battery life is what you would expect with a stick vacuum.  It's not like they included two because the one.....sucks (see what I did there?).  The buttons are easy to use.  Push to turn on, and then use the other two to change the suction power.  You can hold the ""plus"" sign one for a few sections and turn on turbo boost; however, this will cause you to go running for the second battery fairly soon after....but it is very powerful for a stick vacuum.  

Unique features:  Besides the two batteries (see above), there are the wifi features, the extendable ""tube"" and a little flappy pushy doodad that helps empty the dust container.  The wifi features are..neat...but I found after setting it up I don't use it.  On the LG Home app you can see the charge status, how long you've used the vacuum for, and a few other stats.  Nothing that I found very useful other than ""oh thats neat"".  The extendable tube I both like, and dislike.  I like because it makes the vacuum compact and easier to store.  What I don't like, is that the button/slider you use to extend the tube is a little quirky.  It sometimes took me a few tries to get it to extend.  That dirt container thing?  I LOVE.  You open the bottom of the container and push down on a slider that pushes all (most) of the dirt and hair right out and into the trash.  No more digging in and going on a hunt trying to empty it out.  

Overall:  I really like this stick vacuum.  Besides the extending tube quirk, I love everything else about it and that quirk is not enough for me to give it 4 stars rather than 5."
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,5,9/7/2022 17:42,TechNinja,A Strong Performer!,"The LG Cord Zero is a great option at this price point when you compare it to other vacuums in the price range. It has some positives and some flaws as most products do. Anytime you go with a cordless vacuum you will have compromises. However, none of those outweigh the glory of not needing to find an outlet, manage the power cord while vacuuming, and rolling the cable back up. It has changed the way we clean at our house. We vacuum far, far more often now. We never reach for the dustpan and broom either. It’s just so easy to use. 

Pros:

Its very light weight while feeling solid. When using the vacuum, you never feel fatigue. The material choices are excellent. The main shaft slides up and down very easily for adjustment. The dust bin opens in a way that makes it as easy as possible to land the dust into the garbage bin without spills. The stand that comes with the vacuum is very convenient. I did not want to wall mount, so its nice that LG provided a solid solution for a less permanent option. I like that the vacuum doesn’t use a trigger to turn on/off the vacuum function unlike one if its competitors. Instead, it’s just a button located in an easy to press location on the top of the handle. There’s two main modes, normal and turbo. On normal the vacuum feels like the usual for a cordless vacuum. Weak compared to their corded counterparts. That’s ok because that’s literally every cordless vacuum on the market. The most powerful cordless vacuum cannot match the most powerful corded vacuum. However, the LG Cord Zero does have a nice way to get close to the power of a corded vacuum. Turbo mode. With turbo mode, the vacuum achieves very high levels of suction. It will run out of battery quicker in turbo mode, which is to be expected. The last pro I have is the fact that it comes with two batteries. A cordless vacuum with one battery is not the best situation. Luckily, this kit comes with two!

Cons:

There aren’t many cons. It takes a bit of getting used to putting the vacuum in its stand. For a while it will feel difficult, but you get used to it after a while. It could be designed better I feel. The last con is that there aren’t that many attachments included in this kit. It would’ve been nice to get one more vacuum head included in this kit. I went on LG’s website, and they have some cool options to purchase separately, so at least you can get more if you are willing to pay extra.
 Ultimately, the LG Cord Zero is a strong performer. It boasts a useful turbo mode. It feels great to use and is lightweight. It comes with two batteries, and they last a good while. The attachments that did come with the vacuum are useful. You can’t really go wrong at this price point with the LG Cord Zero."
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,5,9/12/2022 11:45,rtbestbuy,Great Addition to a RoboVac Home!,"The LG-CordZero Stick Vacuum with Kompressor technology is a great addition to a robovac home. We live in a house with two dogs who shed and insist on bringing the great outdoors inside. With wood, tile, linoleum and carpeted surfaces, as well as furniture, we added a robovac to the family to try to keep up. RoboVacs are a great 90% solution, but there are still corners, behind doors, furniture, and just the odd spots to vacuum. A rechargeable stick vacuum is a great idea, but most that we tried either just didn't have enough vacuum, capacity, or battery to really work well. The other problem with a 'cordless' is that you have to charge it somewhere, you can't just stick it in a closet. The LG-CordZero solves these problems in a compact, easy to store package.

The LG-CordZero has a very nice charging stand that hides in a cubbyhole nicely (see picture). LG provides a hideaway second battery that can be swapped and charged while the vacuum is in use. The basic vacuum is sufficient for dust, fur, and dirt, and there is a boost and turbo mode for really dirty stuff. It's also great on furniture and blankets. It comes with a 'beater' head, crevice tool and brush attachment which pretty much covers any surface you need to clean. The 'neck' adjusts to accomodate the height of the user.

Setup was a breeze. It literally took us longer to get it out of the box than it did to get it clicked together to use. The instructions are clear and concise. It is WiFi connected, but I found that to be marginally useful. It's not required for operation.

The 'compressor' technology actually works pretty well, at least for fur and dust. There is a lever that you press and it pushes the gunk down into the bottom of the 'gunk' well. Since none of these stick vacuums have much storage, it allows you to empty it much less frequently. It also makes emptying it much easier because you open the bottom, flick the lever a couple of times and it pushes the gunk out the bottom.

All in all, an excellent addition to a robovac home. It would be welcome in a smaller home or as an alternative to pulling out the corded vacuum to vacuum a room or couple of spots. Highly recommended!"
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,5,9/7/2022 21:36,Titan5178,LG Made it even Better!,"I had the older version of this same model and really liked it. This one is even better as the battery runtime has been improved to 60 minutes from 40. There’s still enough suction at regular power that I hardly need to engage the power or turbo mode for any reason. With the included extra battery I can do the entire house while another battery charges in the docking station. 

Another difference is the old model included a hard floor and a carpet attachment. This one just has one universal attachment to do both. I think this approach is much better. I’ve had no issues using this all-in-one attachment to clean both my tile and carpet. It also includes a combination tool that can be used to clean your car or if you use it on the end of the telescoping wand I’m able to get random spiderwebs out of the corners of my 10 foot ceilings. The Power Punch tool has a vibrating feature that allows it to aggravate the dust and debris and remove it from upholstery. There is a 5-step filtration system so there are several filters: a prefilter, 2 “cyclonic”, metal, and fine dust, all of which are both easy to remove and washable.

My old model also did not feature the “Kompressor” technology which compacts the dirt and hair so that it both stores more and is easier to dispose of. It provides a Kompressor Lever that you can utilize while vacuuming to force the dirt into the bottom of the dustcup. I find this to be a valuable new feature because I constantly had to use my finger or remove the filter to get all of the dirt out of the old one.  

Pros:  

High Performance 
Not that noisy 
Includes 2 batteries 
Washable filters 
1 large attachment for all floors 
Multiple smaller attachments 
Kompressor technology 
Wifi enabled 
Docking station can be placed on floor or wall mountable 
10 year motor warranty (1 year general)  

Cons: 

None! 

Overall, this is an excellent cordless stick vacuum and I have no hesitation recommending it to anyone. The increased runtime and extra battery give you two hours which should be enough to cover an average or even large home."
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,5,9/8/2022 10:45,ZachC,Stand Out Cordless Vacuum,"Really impressed with this LG vacuum. It has great suction on our carpet and leaves clean lines. It also works great grabbing crumbs against the baseboards in the kitchen. There are three modes of suction and you just need to press the power button vs holding the trigger like other stick vacuum brands. While turbo mode runs the battery down faster I have yet to run out of battery life before finishing the job. The grip on the back of the handle is nice but I do not really care for the piece inside the handle by my index finger.   While a slight inconvenience, you quickly become used to it being there.  The Kompressor technology works great to make more room for dirt and helps with emptying. It is lighter than other stick vacuums I have used and I like that the stand holds all the attachments and spare battery so you do not have to find another place to store them.  This vaccum has made it fun to clean in our house and its easy for our kids to grab off the stand and use when they need to clean up a mess.  The stand also charges the both batteries so its always ready to go when needed which is really helpful.  The app has a self-diagnostics tool that I have not used yet but may come in handy in the future.  Overall, very happy with the ease of assembly, performance and battery life of this new model from LG.  Highly recommend!"
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,5,9/8/2022 22:07,Derek,LG Continues to Impress with the CordZero,"I’ve owned the first two generations of the CordZero. My wife uses one of them to keep her classroom vacuumed, I keep one upstairs, and this new one downstairs. While I wish it came with a bare floor attachment, the hybrid floor attachment it does come with does a sufficient job on the wood floors I have downstairs while also working well on the carpet on the stairs.

Battery life has improved with each iteration of the CordZero, and it is impressive. I have a 3,000 square foot home, and I rarely need to swap batteries while vacuuming from one end of the house to the other. Plenty of suction power, something the CordZero has always had, while also being lightweight, relatively quiet, and easy to clean. Yes, the CordZero can be pricey. But you get the stand, an extra battery, an extra filter, and all the attachments you need to keep your floors clean. 

The CordZero can also be connected to the internet, but to be honest, I have little to no desire to do so. LG doesn’t need to know how often I use their vacuum or when the filters need to be cleaned… But the CordZero functions just fine without the internet connectivity, and I highly recommend it as a high-end, very capable cordless vacuum."
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,5,9/12/2022 0:33,Sean,So nice I got it twice.,"The LG CordZero stick vacuum is perfect for quick clean ups or for use in small areas. This is actually my second one of these vacuums and the first is still going strong after three years. We have one dedicated to the upstairs and the other mainly stays in the RV. The battery life is more than enough to clean the entire RV. With the addition of the second battery, that is always topped off in the charging base, there is also more than enough life to clean all three upstairs bedrooms and the common area. The Kompressor feature makes for easy emptying of the canister and in the event of picking up a lot of dog hair it can be used to compress it down to continue vacuuming. The telescoping wand is not only useful for saving storage space, but it is actually super useful for when the kids need to do a quick clean up. It's the perfect height for our 8 and 10 year olds. Cleaning the vacuum itself is also a breeze as the filters are easy to get to and the internals of the canister break down very simply.

Lightweight, powerful and easy to use and maintain."
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,5,9/15/2022 8:30,Matt,Unbelievable Vacuum,"I have so much to say about this vacuum and its all good things.

This vacuum is extremely impressive. It comes with a stand, wall charger, spare battery, two separate attachments and a spare filter. The battery lasts quite a long time (I am not sure as to how long because I always keep the device plugged in when not in use. The stand holds both attachment pieces so they are not hanging off the side of the vacuum (like most vacuums). You can adjust the power of the suction on the vacuum which is great. The vacuum while on full power is not also that loud. The suction on all levels is also very good on hardwood floors and carpets. I am a huge fan of how compact the vacuum is. When not in use it's not very tall so its quite compact in a closet. It does of course extend out when in use so not to worry. Aesthetically its a very nice vacuum but don't but a vacuum for aesthetics alone, buy it because it functions and performs well. I highly recommend anyone buy this vacuum for any cleaning use. It's well worth your money."
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,4,9/10/2022 13:15,82jax,"Efficient stick, needs balance.","The vacuum stick has great suction on both hardwood and our area rugs.  It does have some issues trying to pick-up larger debris, but a lot of this is toys you wouldn’t want to be trying pull or dig out later.  It would be nice though in the dining area to be able to grab those larger crumbs at times.  The battery seems to last for quite a while allowing me to get through the entire house and re-touch any areas that need extra attention where there’s high foot traffic from our kids; eating and play areas.  This is in normal mode and switching between batteries after about an hour of use.  Overall this is a good vacuum for everyday light cleaning that is easy to operate and easy to unclog and clean.

An advantage to this is the free standing base for charging and storing the vacuum vice having to hang it on a wall.  Plus having the option to store most attachments to the stand and not having to find a place with others to store the additional accessories.  Just kept readily available what I would use daily and more often for those deeper cleanings.  I did find during use that it did seem a little unbalanced at times in trying to keep it on track with where I was trying to get it go."
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,3,9/9/2022 13:06,TheStump,Expected Way More From This Vacuum,"I expected way more from this LG stick vacuum. While it does clean up fairly well, there are several issues that keep this from being a great stick vacuum. 

Positives first: it is lightweight and compact, has good suction on high, really good suction on turbo, and does a mostly good job picking up dog hair, dirt and dust on most surfaces. The charging station is awesome and dual batteries assure that I can vacuum my whole house and basement without having to recharge (about 3700 sq feet total). I like that the whole unit extends to accommodate my height but also allows easier use on stairs with the shorter length. Possibly my favorite feature is the Kompressor that allows you to compact what you pick up in the canister. This feature allows for a greater capacity as you can compress the stuff in the canister so you don’t have to empty as often.

What keeps this unit from being great are the many negatives: Low speed is mostly useless. I have to use high or turbo to pick everything up off the floor and rugs/carpet. It struggles with larger solids. I believe this is due to the suction not being strong enough. There is no light. For a model at this price point I expected a bright LED to light up the floor. Even much cheaper stick vacuums have this feature. The suction is super weak with the vacuum extended and no attachments. More attachments should be included for the price but they are only available to be purchased separately. 

I would not recommend this vacuum and would suggest anyone looking for a stick vacuum to look elsewhere."
bestbuy,LG A925KSM,1,9/6/2022 12:03,Austin,Poor suction,Does not pick items up well. I regret this purchase completely. Always feel like its on low power mode. I push items around too often and it does not pull them up becauce it does not have the power. Would not recommend
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/7/2022 17:17,Curmudgeon1,"POWERFUL, LIGHTWEIGHT & EFFICIENT STICK VACUUM","The LG CordZero A925KSM Kompressor Stick Vacuum is similar to some other LG cordless vacuum models, and that is a very good thing.  The LG A925KSM is an excellent cordless stick vacuum that performs very well and is very pleasant and easy to use.

The LG CordZero A925KSM Kompressor arrives very well packed and includes the vacuum motor power head, an aluminum telescoping extension wand (20” collapsed, 29.5” extended), a universal power nozzle (for carpet and bare floors), a combination tool (with removable brush), a crevice tool, a free-standing / wall mountable, portable storage stand with integral battery charger, two lithium ion rechargeable batteries, a spare pre-filter for the motor and a small brush for cleaning the dirt collection canister and motor housing.

Assembly of the charging stand is straightforward, and LG provides a quantity of printed product documentation.  The stand has a weighted base, which I found to be very stable.  The stand may also be wall mounted.  The hardware for wall attachment is included.  Notably, all of the included components and accessories are accommodated on the charging stand!  

The combination tool and crevice tool attachments can be used with or without the telescoping extension wand, easily accommodating cleaning out of reach areas, as well as close-up cleaning tasks such as upholstered furniture.  The telescoping wand provides four latching positions.  All of the attachments easily snap together and latch securely.

Cordless stick vacuums are particularly attractive and desirable for their light weight, easy maneuverability and superior convenience.  The LG CordZero A925 Kompressor excels in those attributes.  

The vacuum weighs only 5.95 lbs, with most of the weight concentrated in the motor unit and battery.  The handle is large and comfortable.  The thumb operated power on/off switch and motor speed control switches (+ / -) are conveniently located and easily operated.  Switches only require momentary depression and do not need to be held continuously during operation as some stick vacuums require.

The power vacuum nozzle is equipped with a ball-gimbal mount which affords outstanding maneuverability and directional control.  The CordZero easily reaches under low furniture, and is easily maneuvered next to walls and furnishings for excellent edge cleaning.

The power vacuum nozzle contains a motorized 9” brushroll which operates at all times for both carpeted and hard surface floors.  A pair of small rollers facilitates movement on carpeting, but nevertheless, there are times when forward motion required additional physical effort.  I found that a high angle of attack exacerbated that issue, and lowering the angle of the stick vacuum reduced the level of required effort.  However, I also found that lowering the angle of attack often necessitates bending slightly to lower the handle/stick.  This created an occasional annoyance.  This issue does not result from the telescoping extension wand being too short.  Rather, it is a product of the design of the leading edge of the of the power nozzle which can embed in carpet pile.

LG provides a specification of 200 watts of suction power.  If LG is actually describing an air watts rating, 200 watts is double the required 100 air watt standard for upright vacuums, and is only slightly below the 220 air watt standard for canister vacuums.

I found the suction power to be more than adequate.  The CordZero A925 provides three motor speeds (power levels) labeled as Normal, Power and Turbo.  The default, Normal mode proved to be extremely effective on both hard and carpeted surfaces.  The Power and Turbo motor speeds reduce battery run-time and increase noise level.

LG claims 40 minutes of operation (per battery) in Normal mode, 20 minutes in Power mode and 6 minutes in Turbo mode when using the floor cleaning Universal Power Nozzle.  When used with a non-powered tool, the claimed operating times are 60 minutes in Normal mode, 30 minutes in Power mode and 7 minutes in Turbo mode.  When used with the power nozzle the claimed run times are 40 minutes in Normal mode, 20 minutes in Power mode and 6 minutes in Turbo mode.  Using two fully charged batteries provides for doubling of the foregoing operating times.  The power unit of the vacuum has an LED display with 3 incremental bars for battery capacity.  After using the LG A925 several times, we believe that with the two included batteries, whole house cleaning is well within expectations.

The lithium ion, batteries are 25.9 volt, 2.4 Ah / 62.16 Wh (2.3 Ah / 59.57 Wh minimum) capacity.  Replacement batteries are expensive so they should be properly maintained.  Battery charging is accommodated by charging one battery while attached to the vacuum motor unit as well as the second battery in the charging stand.  Batteries are not charged simultaneously;  they are charged sequentially.  The charging stand first charges the battery which is attached to the vacuum, and upon completion, then charges the second battery in the stand.  Each battery requires approximately 4 hours to fully charge (8 hours to charge both batteries).

Completion of charging of each battery is annunciated by LED indicators (3 incremental LED bars on the vacuum handle for attached battery, and a single LED on the charging stand for second battery).  Completed charging of the primary battery is also annunciated by a push-notification to the available LG Thin-Q smartphone app.  The built-in LED panel also shows the progress of charging, the need for filter cleaning, detection of a clogged vacuum flow-path and indicates if Wi-Fi is active.

I already had the Thin-Q app installed on my LG smartphone.  Nevertheless, it required a few attempts to finally connect the vacuum with the app via wi-fi.  The CordZero communicates only on 2.4GHz wi-fi.

The Thin-Q app tracks usage of the CordZero by date and cleaning sessions, reporting total hours/minutes of use.  It also displays the duration of use in each of the three power modes, and notifies the user when filters require cleaning.  Additional data granularity might be useful, such as displaying the duration of individual cleaning sessions, rather than just the grand total of each day’s use.  

The Thin-Q app displays when the battery attached to the vacuum is being charged and when it is fully charged.  It does not provide any additional battery status data such as the remaining capacity of the battery (% remaining), and when charging, the progress of the charge (% charged – time remaining to 100%).  There is no information provided for the second battery.

One improvement that I believe would be beneficial and appreciated would be the addition of an LED display (with pushbutton) on the LG batteries.  Every tool battery pack that I own has such a display.  It is very convenient to be able to simply press the button momentarily and for the approximate current remaining charge level of the battery to be instantly displayed on the LED lamps.

Air filtration is comprised of multiple filter elements and is listed as being 5 stage HEPA filtration.  The filters are removable and washable.  A spare pre-filter is also included.  

The small dust collection bin can fill quickly.  The CordZero A925 Kompressor employs a very unique lever operated “piston” to compress the dust and pet hair in the bin, thereby extending the intervals between emptying.  A single press of the release latch quickly and neatly dumps the contents of the dust bin.

I am hopeful that the CordZero A925 proves to be durable and reliable, but of course, only time will tell.  The unit is comprised of a significant quantity of plastic components.  The latch and hinge which secure the dust collection bin appear to potentially be fragile.  Nevertheless, the vacuum appears to have a high quality build, with a solid feel and well made and nicely finished components.  The LG CordZero A925 Kompressor is a high-quality stick vacuum!

Overall, the LG CordZero A925 Kompressor stick vacuum is excellent.  It is compact, lightweight, easily maneuverable, and efficient.  It is powerful, yet not unpleasantly noisy.  It is well-equipped with accessories which attach and detach with ease, and all of which have dedicated storage places on the included charging/storage stand.  The two large capacity batteries provide approximately two hours of run-time with the non-powered tools or approximately 80 minutes of operating time when used with the power nozzle, which is more than adequate for thoroughly cleaning a large house.  The vacuum cleaning power and efficiency are great.

I believe that you will be just as thoroughly pleased and satisfied with the excellent CordZero A925 Kompressor stick vacuum as we are with ours!"
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/7/2022 13:02,Pilgrim007,"Highly portable, yet powerful stick vacuum","The LG CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum is a great looking, relatively light vacuum cleaner which fits in nicely between our existing corded and robot vacuum cleaners.

Unboxing and assembly seemed to take longer than I had anticipated, as some of the references in the quick-start and instructions referred to items that were not included in my set. It appears that there are three different flavors of this vacuum and although I am happy with mine, it had references to accessories, an accessory holder and mopping ability which this one does not have. Again, not a problem as I did not get the vacuum for mopping but it was a bit confusing at first to use the one-size-fits-all instructions.

The manual advises charging the batteries before usage so I timed it and it was about an hour or so before the battery was fully charged. Once the vacuum charging mount is assembled, it provides a spot to charge the battery as well as dock the vacuum with its-on-board battery and both will charge in sequence. This means that once the primary battery runs out, you can just swap it out for the spare and then charge that one as you continue cleaning, doubling the effective running time. The vacuum itself will slide down the very top part of the mount and once settled there, it will charge the on-board battery as the other battery remains below, in its mount – very clever!

The charging mount can be free-standing or attached to a wall with the included mounting hardware. You can even dispense with the stand’s foot if you are wall mounting and don’t need to free-stand the vacuum. I am using the freestanding mount for now but will likely mount it later down the line.

The stand includes two accessory mount points which securely hold the two included tools (crevice and soft brush). It means that the accessories are not with you as you clean but they are at least in an obvious storage spot. Even some corded standing vacuums don’t have the tools on board so this is not a big deal but I occasionally see something I wish I had the tool for and then have to really want it, to stop what I am doing and head back to base for the tool.

The vacuum can join your Wi-Fi network and then the LG ThinQ app will track things like battery life, cleaning history and other interesting but not necessary data. For me, it is mostly a novelty but I do like when the app notifies me that the batteries are fully charged again.

Using the vacuum is quite liberating. After years of cleaning a 2600 square foot home with various corded vacuums, it was eye-opening to take the same route with a cordless vacuum.

With the universal floor tool attached, I found I was moving around quicker than with the corded. As the vacuum is lighter and did not have as aggressive beater bar inside the floor tool, I was concerned it wasn’t as powerful as the corded. It certainly leaves less obvious marks on the carpet but still seemed to collect the same amount of carpet fiber, pet hair and other debris. The manual had warned that the universal floor tool might be loud on hard surfaces but I did not really notice and it did fine on our mix of carpet, vinyl and laminate floor.

Being able to just keep going where I would previously have to retrace my steps, in order not to exceed the power cord length was great. In addition, the Kompressor technology helps to reduce stops and visits to empty the debris cannister in the garbage. The Kompressor really is just a push button slide that pushes hair, carpet fiber etc. down near the bottom of the cannister so you can continue vacuuming for longer. I found it did reduce stops but did not really push it to the limit, in case it reduced cleaning power. It also helped keep the cannister cleaner as debris wasn’t able to just gather at the top although it remains to be seen if that will continue to work or dust will build up near the top over time. That said, the manual said you could wash out the cannister so it may not be an issue if you keep up with maintenance.

I was able to do about three quarters of our house, including stairs, with a single battery on normal power. Occasionally I would boost the power to get something embedded in the carpet but did not need the turbo function yet. The LG documentation shows that the battery life is drastically reduced if you run it in the higher modes for too long so I was careful.

Swapping batteries was painless other than the vacuum abruptly stopping and needing to walk back to the charging station to swap them over. I then had plenty of power to return upstairs and finish the last two rooms.

The app kept track of running time and battery status as I cleaned which was interesting but not especially useful. Perhaps over time it could be but the jury is still out for me on the app right now. At worst, it might be helpful when it comes time to replace some of the consumable parts like filters and batteries, which LG warns will wear out and need to be replaced at some point.

In summary, I am very happy with the portability and power of this vacuum and it seemed to be on par with the bigger, heavier corded vacuum we own. It could be run as a stick vacuum or you could remove the stick part and use it to clean stairs or inside a car, with lots of power and even more portability to get in smaller spaces. The battery life is good enough to clean a fairly large house, especially as it comes with two batteries and one can always be on charge. The Kompressor tech is useful but not especially glamorous – still makes it better than most cannisters in terms of keeping them clean and how often they need emptying before they affect the cyclone effect. 

Great job LG!"
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/7/2022 16:19,MrGadget,LG CordZero A925KSM Cordless Stick Is A STANDOUT,"This LG Cord Zero cordless stick vacuum with Kompressor technology comes with two batteries for extended run time and a clever dirt squisher.

Kompressor technology is a clever built-in feature that compresses the dirt in the dust bin so it does not need to be emptied as often. Moving a lever is all it takes to squish the bin contents.

Get up to 120 minutes of uninterrupted performance with a pair of included batteries. These batteries are said to be an upgraded lithium-ion design that can take repeated charges and discharges and come back for more.

A portable charging stand is provided that holds the CordZero in place and does not require holes to be drilled into a wall, though wall mounting is an option.

One-touch controls turn the vacuum on and off and adjust power levels up to Turbo mode with just a thumb. This should prove to be less strenuous on the hand.

Telescope the wand for greater flexibility and to more conveniently store the unit away while taking up less space.

Removable and washable filters extend the life of the vacuum. In addition, the cyclone system is removable and washable.

A Smart Inverter Motor creates powerful suction and is backed by a 10-year limited warranty (the motor, not the batteries).

The ThinQ app for iOS and Android allows users to check on the vacuum’s cleaning history and perform product diagnostics.

Convertible from a stick to a hand vac, clean floors, furniture and vehicle interiors. Use the included Universal Power Nozzle when in hand vac mode.

LG CordZero is recommended for homes with minimal carpeting or rugs. It is not recommended for use on any fiber floor covering with medium to deep pile, the same as for any vacuum with a spinning brush head.

**WHAT’S IN THE BOX**

• A925KSM CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum (Six pounds w/o accessories)
• Telescoping wand
• Universal Power Nozzle
• 2 Quick Release Batteries
• Portable Charging Station
• Crevice Tool
• Extra Pre-filter
• AC Power Adapter

**THE SETUP**

Manuals read, BOTH batteries charged (can take up to 240 minutes from fully discharged), it’s time to . . .

**PUT IT TO THE TEST**

A strong, not too loud, motor whir tells me this stick means business.There is plenty of suction even on the lowest power setting. Once it hits a low-pile rug, the power level should be increased for effectiveness, which it to be expected. 

The Kompressor lever is a novel gimmick and it works. As the bin fills, the contents tend to coalesce near the cyclonic ports. Using the Kompressor lever allows the dirt, dust and other debris to be compressed and directed to the bottom of the bin so it does not appear to require emptying so frequently. Who thought of this clever idea?

Battery performance has been as expected, with both batteries providing enough power to clean everywhere. I like the ease-of-use when vacuuming inside our cars. 

Easy to empty, and the simple, washable filter is very effective. There are no consumables to deal with on a regular basis, though the filters will degrade over time. The batteries will eventually need to be replaced. Of equal importance is that the design does not create the need for unusual and unplanned deep cleaning of the CordZero itself.

The brush head is easy to dismantle for removal of anything wrapped around the brush. A quarter-turn of the red screw on the bottom releases the cover for brush head access.

There have been no clogs to remove.

The Wi-Fi-enabled ThinQ App’s monitoring shows a detailed cleaning history and other stats but is, in my mind, a feature that is not so important or relevant to this reviewer.

Everyone here is pretty impressed with this LG CordZero.

**CONCLUSION**

Easy to set up. Easy to use. Easy to like, even love. Very easy to recommend.

**WARRANTY**

Manufacturer’s one year warranty from the date of the original purchase, and 10 years on the Smart Inverter Motor"
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/9/2022 20:10,TechGeek,Powerful compact stick vacuum!,"Compact, bagless, super light and yet a powerful stick vacuum with tons of features. It came with an extra battery and an extra pre-filter along with a combination and crevice tool. The first thing I noticed on this superlight stick vacuum is the adjustable or telescopic wand and the Kompressor lever. The standalone charging base has an option to charge the second battery. The batteries themselves are compact and each battery is good for 60 min operation.  
	
Design:
	Small form factor with a base station to charge the stick vacuum and the additional battery. The charging station or the base is heavy enough to hold the stick vacuum in place and I didn't have to worry about drilling holes in the walls to keep it secure. It does come with a wall mount option as well. I like the telescopic wand, lets me get under the furniture and everyone in my house including the kids can use it. The best part is the Kompressor lever that really compresses the dirt and keeps the filter free of debris. It will be a while before I have to empty the bin. It also helps clean the bin and not have to worry about getting your fingers in to pull the debris out- good thinking LG! The filters can be removed easily and washed in the sink. The best part is the roller or the brush head that can be easily removed by just twisting one end, and it slides right out. The roller has minimalist design, can twist, and turn easily to go around the corners and is powerful enough to pick up fine debris, and they are so easy to clean! The cyclone head slides right out as well and can be easily cleaned and washed in the sink. I started using this vacuum over other cordless ones that I have, just because of its design and the ease with which it can be cleaned. All the controls on the vacuum can be easily accessed with your thumb. I downloaded the LG ThinQ app to monitor its usage and diagnose issues right on the phone. I like the turbo mode option, gives me the ability to crank up the suction power to deep clean my rugs! I noticed the battery life reduce quite a bit (think about 20 mins) when I had the turbo mode on. The vacuum has three suction levels - normal, power, and turbo. The turbo mode definitely does get the job done when it comes to picking up fine dust. 
	
Function:
	Coming to the suction power, I was impressed on how good it was it in picking up the fine dust from the rugs.  The five-stage filtration system speaks for itself when you see the bin filled with fine dust! I live in a dry state and dust accumulation is a major problem and I can see using this vacuum every other day. It worked great on carpet and on hardwood floors and my only complaint was it has a small opening in the front, and it struggles to pick up large debris on the hardwood floors. 
	
	Overall, I highly recommend this powerful vacuum just for the fact it has good suction power and ease of maintenance. It literally took me less than 10 minutes to clean the filter and the cyclone head, empty the dust bin, and clean the debris off the roller. It’s a little expensive but is comparable to the name brand ones on the suction power, but definitely beats the rest on ease of maintenance. I had it for over 2 weeks and used it every other day and happy with its suction power and battery life!"
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/7/2022 13:38,DeeGore,Nice experience!,"I have several vacuum cleaners, even though I don’t really enjoy vacuuming. I like the end result, but the actual process of vacuuming is a chore. I have never used a cordless stick vacuum like this LG one though. This vacuum is pretty quiet, which is saying a lot since I think most vacuum cleaners are loud as heck. And the air that blows out when I use it isn’t hot air. That is one of the big negatives about my standard stand up vac. I get so hot and sweaty whenever I use it, not just from pushing it around but the hot air that blows on me the whole time. This one is so effortless, it’s weird. I actually enjoy using it.

This LG came with a wall-mount stand for the vac, but at this point, I’m not going to be installing that permanently on my wall somewhere. I have shared a picture of how to charge this vac if you chose to go unmounted like me. This vac came with a regular nozzle, combination tool, crevice tool and a cleaning brush. The cleaning brush is a nice touch because I really can get up and in the dirt cup with it to dislodge some of the hair that doesn’t want to fall out when I open the latch. It also came with an extra prefilter, which is nice. That has to be washed once in a while so it can be switched out and you can keep on vacuuming while one is hanging to dry. This vac comes with two batteries, so you can always have a backup. This vac comes with a nice maintenance guide which feels like a plastic sheet. It has a little suction cup so you can stick it somewhere to be able to reference as needed. There are several things you can do to keep this vac stick in good operating mode, so this is a good tool to remind you. I myself find it very satisfying to pop open the dirt cup and dump it into the trash can. 

I really like this stick vac to suck up the hair on my bathroom floor. With my regular push vac, it always sucks up the rugs that I have in there and it’s a pain. With this stick I just sweep with it and my rugs don’t get disturbed. There is a turbo power button for extra vacuum power. I use that when I can but definitely do just fine with regular mode on the tile floor. If I had just hard surface floors I could see just owning this vac stick. It’s so easy to use. The extension pipe that connects the nozzle to the vac unit can be used with the other tools, and it extends. If you are short or tall it can be adjusted to your liking. This is also very good for vacuuming up at the ceiling level, etc. It is very nice to be cordless. This is also nice for left handed users. Half of my family is left handed, but not me. I pay a lot of attention to how right handed everything is, and since this is cordless, it’s going to be easier to use with either hand.

I connected this to my LG ThinQ app, it wasn’t too difficult. I already had the app because I have an LG smart TV, but for some reason, that isn’t on the app anymore and I couldn’t reconnect it. I’ll work on that later. Why connect a vacuum cleaner to a smart app? Well, it lets me know when my battery is finished charging. That’s actually very nice. It also tells me how many times someone has used the vac, and for how long. So if you want to keep tabs on that, here you go.  Multiple people can share this info, they can all download the app."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,9/8/2022 10:02,AtlantaGreg,A handy manageably-sized vacuum,"The LG A9 CordZero is the latest in LG’s stick vacuum cleaner models.  I have one of the earliest versions and for the most part was happy with it, but there were a couple of buggy things I didn’t like and this one seems to have cleared those up. The CordZero comes with several accessories and mine came with the main vacuum head (10.2 inches wide) with extension pipe, a second battery, a spare air filter (one is already inserted), a crevice tool and another with a brush, along with a cleaning brush to help clean the canister out.  A stand is also included which is very handy as you can set the main container unit in it to charge the battery and hold it.  I use mine on it’s included stand on the floor, but you can mount it on the wall if you prefer. 

The CordZero is smaller compared to some other stick vacuums, so has a smaller dirt container on it.  My older model would get easily clogged with dirt and frankly was a little bit of a pain to clean out.  The newer A9 model has a lever which they call a Kompressor lever, and you just slide it down a couple of times when emptying the bin, and it forces anything stuck in the upper area out – MUCH easier than before.  Being smaller makes it easier to handle as it doesn’t weight much, and the main head swivels and pivots easily around furniture and gets into smaller areas.  Unfortunately, there is no LED light on it to light up your path, though.  It will let you know when the air filter needs to be changed, but they last a good while.  The roller in the main vacuum head slides out for cleaning as well.

You have three levels of power (normal, power, and turbo), so your battery life will vary depending on what you use.  Normal can get you from 40-60 minutes, but I find this is best for just light duty work.  Power mode is noticeably stronger, and you’ll get from 20-30 minutes per charge on that setting.  The Turbo mode is the strongest and works the best, but you’ll drain the battery in just 6-7 minutes using this.  Having the second battery is essential for this machine, but since the stand can charge both of them at the same time, you’ll be topped off when you need to use it.  Again, I find the Power mode to be the sweet spot of good cleaning power and battery power.  The handle is easy to hold, and the buttons easy to reach while using it (via your thumb).  At only just over 10 inches, the main vacuum head won’t cover huge areas per swath, so if you have HUGE rooms and a lot of them, you might need to look for a larger model, but for many, this one and the two batteries should work. And note – this is NOT for wet vacuuming – just dry dirt, dust, hair, etc.

You can download the “LG ThinQ” app from Apple or Google with this model, and it will connect via WiFi to the vacuum (2.4 Ghz only), so after creating an account with it and picking the item you have, you can monitor how often you’ve cleaned it, if the filter is getting clogged up, or run diagnostics should you feel there is an issue.  Handy to have to monitor the status of the vacuum and easy enough to navigate through once you get it installed, though it was a bit buggy and unnecessarily fiddly to get connected and working initially for me (eventually it kicked in, though).

Overall I really like this updated model.  It works as well or slightly better than the original, the Kompressor lever makes cleaning it out much easier, and the size is perfect for many.  My only complaint that remains with this one is that the main cleaning head isn’t so great with certain larger items (hair if you get an indoor haircut, nuts, etc), so you have to slightly lift up the head and pull it backward over those items to catch them.  Not a game changer, but something to be aware of. Other than that, it works very well on my carpet and hardwood.  Look for sale prices but most of these aren’t inexpensive, but it’s worth it for what you get."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/8/2022 18:14,MarkusKong,Amazing Cordless Vacuum w/ Swappable Battery!,"Looking for a powerful cordless stick vacuum with the ability to hot swap batteries to complete the necessary cleaning job? The LG CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum with Kompressor technology has you covered ladies and gentlemen.

I personally own a Dyson Cyclone V10 which technically is 4 years or so old now and I remember when I first got it; the one thing I had an issue with the most was the battery life. I would have it on high and it would last maybe 20 minutes or so. So I had to sacrifice the suction power to make the battery last a bit longer. Well, with the LG CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum with Kompressor technology I can get a solid 2 hours or so thanks to LG for including an additional battery. So while using one of the batteries you can have the other one charging.

I really enjoyed the usability and comfortability of the LG CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum with Kompressor technology. Instead of having to constantly hold down a trigger to operate this vacuum; it has a one touch control so that you can literally just touch it with your finger to start it and touch it again to stop it. When it comes to the suction power on my hard floors; it really does an amazing job with picking up dust and hair. I also like that I can use different attachments for the cleaning job so if I need to make the LG CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum with Kompressor technology more portable for lets say vacuuming my car; I have that option.  You may think that the dust compartment is small but thanks to the Kompressor technology that LG is using; the dust is compacted so that you can complete your cleaning job before having to empty the bin. Once the cleaning job is complete you’re probably wondering what about maintenance right? Well, LG has graciously provided the ability to remove the filters and wash them.

Overall I must say that I am really happy with the LG CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum with Kompressor technology. Now I have the ability to do an amazing vacuuming job for 2 hours and don’t have to always worry about going to empty the dustbin all at the same time."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,9/9/2022 19:06,hahanson,There's a Lot To Love,"We have a travel trailer we rent out during the summers, so once a week we are always cleaning, readying the trailer for the next rental. I have to admit the Dyson V8 we've had for a couple of years has been a godsend. It's light, easy to maneuver, and very powerful -- and cordless. Overlooking the fact that the battery only lasted about 8 min on maximum power, it was perfect. There was nothing else that compared. Until now.

After spending some time with the LG - CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum with Kompressor technology, I think it’s perfect for anyone who wants a premium cordless vacuum that has an awesome charging stand, excellent dirt pickup, and the convenience of an easily replaceable battery to make quick work of any cleaning.

I have to admit the Dyson seems to have more powerful suction, but the LG does almost as well while offering conveniences the Dyson simply can't. The stand can go anywhere (you don't have to drill it into a wall), and charges the CordZero when placed in the stand. The stand also has an additional charging station for the included spare battery. Should the CordZero run out of juice while you're cleaning, simply detach the battery and swap in the fully charged one and continue with what you're doing. No waiting forever while the battery charges. Run time on max power was better than expected at 15 minutes per battery, giving 30 min at max, and almost 2 hours on the standard power setting. The stand also served as storage for the brush and crevice attachments.

The Kompressor is a terrific feature that allows you to press down on a button to compact dust, dirt and other debris in the storage container. It also makes it easier when emptying into the garbage. The CordZero came with 3 washable filters.

Overall, the CordZero A9 offers a lot of value, despite its premium-level cost. The CordZero is solidly constructed and cleans incredibly well. While it has a lot of things going for it, what really stands out for me is the self-standing dock, which, in my opinion, is the best I've come across and is incredibly versatile as it is portable, holds additional attachments, and allows me to charge two batteries simultaneously."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/7/2022 19:14,bckrupps37,Love having 2 removable batteries,"Pros:
-Good power on normal mode (no need to stress the battery life)
-Nice and quiet even on turbo mode
-Includes a spare filter
-Filters are washable
-There are multiple ways to configure the charging stand including strong hidden sticky pads so you don’t have to drill into the wall (The stand without the additional mount was fine for me)
-You can charge both batteries at one time on the charging stand
-The charging stand holds almost all of its attachments
-on/off button on the handle. (Trigger buttons are not fun)
-Adjustable telescopic handle is great for taller people like me that are 6’2”

Cons:
-The dust bin is not that large although the emptying lever is great
-I wish the powered mop attachment could be bought separately in the USA because I would buy it right away.


The best cordless vacuum on the market based on the removable batteries, runtime and the better build quality and features vs competitors. It’s great for hardwood, rugs and getting under the beds and furniture wasn’t a problem either."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/30/2022 15:46,TanyaT,"Best vacuum I have purchased, ever!","I have always had issues with having to empty the bin on my previous Dysons, and that was my main peeve with those vacuums.  I have a disability, so I don’t vacuum as often as I would like, so there is more lint, dust, etc., when I do, hence I am constantly emptying the bin because Dysons can barely hold anything. My last one accidentally sucked up a small stick my dog tracked in from the backyard that blended in with the hardwood floor, and it punctured the interior of the filter, and basically ruined my last Dyson, as it never worked right since. 

But with this machine, I can vacuum as much as I want, and with a push of a button, it just compacts everything and makes more room. For the price, there is nothing better for bin space, and with the backup battery, I can do the whole house with no issues (something I also couldn’t do with a Dyson).

This was the best investment, period. Especially if you can grab it on sale with a 0% finance deal."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/17/2022 22:41,JacG,light and handy vacuum that makes cleaning fun,"* Assembly was very easy; pretty much did it just by looking at the pieces.
* The stand works out very well as we can keep it conveniently at any place that we want.
* Our kitchen floor is tiled, and it helps keep the surface free of solid food pieces from peanuts to rice to cookie crumbs,..
* I use it to clean the rug in the formal dining room and in our living room. It does clean the carpets well; however, I felt it having a little difficulty (it can be easily overcome by adjusting the angle of attack) to easily move forward on certain carpet types.
* it does well on the remaining hardwood floor we have and also nice with getting rid of little indoor spider webs on curtains and all nooks and corners.

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,2,10/27/2022 18:20,AngW,inconvenient dustbin,"I do not like this vacuum. Mainly because emptying the dustbin is too long of a process which creates a mess and leaves you w/o a vacuum for 24hrs while the filter dries. Otherwise, I do like the maneuverability but it does take multiple times for it to pick up some of the slightly bigger pieces on my hardwood floors. Haven't used it on the carpet to review that."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,9/19/2022 11:23,KansasMeddlingMom,"Great Machine Experience, Awful App Experience","I received the LG - CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum with Kompressor, model A925KSM in a huge box with lots of parts that needed to be put together. First, the construction of the actual vacuum, including the telescopic wand is no problem. Then you must put together the charging stand and thread the charging cord through the back of that said stand. That takes a little bit of nimbleness, but not too bad otherwise.

First the good. I have the stand stored in a utility-type closet that has an outlet to plug into, nice way to keep it out of the way and my area clutter-free. So, like other cordless stick vacuums, the motor assembly clicks into the telescoping wand and  makes the unit top heavy and unable to stand on its own unless you lean it against something. This configuration has 2 batteries that are chargeable at the same time, so there should be no reason that you can not be able to get a nice, long vacuuming time no matter how large an area you may need to do. I am not sensitive to noise, but my husband is and he even commented on how quiet the motor was on the highest turbo level setting. I personally love the telescoping wand because it allows for comfort, no matter how short or tall the person vacuuming is. By the way, the wand must be at its shortest length when you click it on the charging stand, you will hear a tinkling sound that lets you know that you have properly attached the vacuum unit to the stand and the battery indicator on the front of the unit will have lines going up the shape of the battery.

In 2019 I got the prior model to this one, the paperwork and brochure that I received at the time called it the A9. The Kompressor is a welcome new addition. If you look at the picture I have included, it is the red push rod that helps push out the dirt and other contents of the collection bin when you open the door or flap to that container. One of my chief complaints, and there must have been many others that felt this way, was that when you opened the dust bin, the filter unit always came loose and you needed either your hands or something else to grab the dirt in the bin. Well, this has now been remedied.

Now the bad and the ugly. I was having a terrible time getting my unit to connect with the app through the WiFi, etc. I have an android phone and I downloaded the LG Thin app. You use this app to register the unit's warranty and add the device, through your WiFi, whether that be a home or office. The instructions specifically state that you cannot use either the WiFi setting, but your location's network and that also cannot be a 5G frequency, but must use a 2.4 GHZ one. I have encountered that before and have the option to set my network on that setting. The instructions also state that you should physically be near your router with the vacuum and your phone, too. While I did that, I found it ridiculous that with my strength of router plus extender on the second floor that I would have to do this. However, I tried at several different times and places to no avail to get this linked and I knew that this aspect was one of the items that LG wanted commentary on.    

Good thing that the 800# is open 24/7. I called over the weekend when I had more time and ran into a terrible experience. First, they offshore you to the Philippines and my customer service person, Kristine, did not speak English like an American does. So, not only did I find it difficult to understand her, I requested that she slow down and spell some of her words because I did not understand what she was saying. I wound up asking her to let me talk several times. Usually at the beginning of a customer service troubleshoot phone call, the operator asks for various set up information, which she never did, and they also ask for the model number so they can reference instructions for that specific unit. I told her my problem and had to stop her and say that ""Don't you need the model number."" Bottom line, it was very obvious that she was not trained to be able to troubleshoot on this machine and certainly could not communicate with me. She gave me the phone number for the app department, not a toll free call, by the way. I spent 60 minutes on the phone with her to no resolve.

While I was waiting on the phone during the many times that she put me on hold, I though what if I delete the device and then try to add it again. I did this 5 times until it finally worked after I got off the phone. The really bad and ugly part is that I did nothing different all these times until it finally worked. I had added it the very 1st time, but it was offline and never connected. After 7-10 times of adding and deleting, it worked. As I write this review, 1 day later, the unit is still connected to the app. After trying everything I knew to do and getting the unit to connect with the app through WiFi, I put it back on the charging stand and have opened up the app, from time to time, and checked on the status, to see if it is still connected.This app uses GPS to identify where the LG item is physically located and it states the status of the machine. So, right now it states that the unit is ""Fully Charged..."" So, it let me know when it was charging and even sent a notification when it was fully charged. I thank goodness that all of this finally worked out, but in my case it took way too much time, energy, and effort, and when I reached out to the supposed experts at customer service, that went no where, too. By the way, when the machine is not on, you can use the Smart Diagnose button , follow it through to do a product check. In my case,, it did not detect abnormal operation, checking the suction motor, filter and whether the filter needs cleaning, the battery, and if there is any restrained spinning. It dates and time stamps the diagnosis along with general maintenance tips  

The good is the machine, its operation, and cleaning tools plus replacement parts included, the bad-what is up with the app??? In conclusion, I took 1 star away from my review and even considered taking 2 away. As a consumer, you need to evaluate what is most important to you."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/15/2022 18:32,bd43274,well designed and thought out offering from LG,"I'll preface this by saying this review doesn't live in a ""vacuum"", pun intended. I have had a few of these stick vacuums over the years, and they've mostly been the same brand, probably the most popular brand in the category. That being said, that manufacturer should be paying attention, this LG is a more than worthy competitor, and is better in some ways that may just prove to be the tipping point for many consumers in the market for one and doing a direct comparison. As such, most of my review points are going to be a bit of a direct comparison to the LG's more expensive competitor.

pros:

	- build quality - Better build quality than what I'm used to. The components feel sturdy and well made, certainly well thought out and engineered. It's very obvious that the team at LG saw something on the market and didn't seek to reinvent the wheel, only to make it better.

	- adjustable height - How novel, a telescoping main tube that you can slide back and forth, depending on your height and comfort level?

	- ""kompressor""/filter clear switch - This is a really cool feature. Use this external switch to push an internal ring down inside the filter, sort of tamping down the contents. Helps to clear the suction area and to create create more capacity. Akin to pushing down the trash when it gets full so you can fit more in, only significantly less gross since here your hands don't get dirty.

	- floor stand - Also a nice touch, the included floor stand let's you have a bit more freedom over where the vacuum is stored, though it is still attached via power cable. Nice to not have to drill into the wall unless you actually want to though.

	- button operation (instead of trigger) - Not the biggest of ""pros"" of course, but operating via button (including multiple levels of suction per press) instead of a trigger. 

	- 2 batteries included, removable - Another win for this model in my opinion is the inclusion of 2 *removable* batteries, and the ability to charge both at the same time - one in the vacuum itself and the other cleverly tucked away in the stand. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 hours on the lowest setting and 15 minutes on the highest, it's very easy to switch to the other battery to keep things moving (and continue to charge the other battery without missing a beat!)

	- suction - All other technology aside, it actually does a fairly good job of cleaning both carpets and hard floors. It is, however, still a stick vacuum, and while good for day to day cleaning, probably not the deepest clean you'll get. Larger pieces of mess (we have birds at home that make massive messes with seemingly entire giant pieces of nut/seed/what have you) aren't always picked up on the first pass.
	



cons:
	- no smaller hand held roller at this price point - While it is cheaper than some other manufacturers, I still would've like to have had the smaller roller brush, for pet hair on couches and similar messes.



misc:
	- wifi/app connection - I'm not sure how useful this will be, but there is the ability to connect via WIFI and get the ""status"" as well as cleaning log. Probably not something I'll use a ton.


overall:
	There are quite a few options out there in this category, but this is definitely one of the stronger ones. Easy 5 stars for me."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/7/2022 22:30,skylog,Great performance/design. Versatile. Great to use.,"To sum it up, I really like this vacuum. There was definitely some thought put into the design, it works very well, it is versatile, and using it seems less of a chore than other vacuums I have used in the past.

Unboxing and setup are what you would expect, nothing out of the ordinary. Simple, quick, and straightforward. I needed to get the batteries charged up, but I was otherwise ready to go in no time. I did also spend some time installing the suggested App. You can see battery levels, some other usage data that frankly, I am not sure I am interested in, and some diagnostic stuff that may prove useful. I will have to see over time. Probably worth the install.

As for the vacuum itself, it has the same quality I have seen in other LG products I have used. Everything is solidly built and put together well. That said, I was kind of pleasantly surprised with how lightweight it was in hand. A big change from the “ancient” standard corded vacuum I have been using. It is very strange for me. I also really like the “controls.” Easy power on and off, levels, and power mode. Simple. Convenient. Comfortable (no trigger thankfully).

You get a rather nice stand/mount that I am still trying to determine how I want to set up. Once I decide on a location, I will probably go with the wall option. I really like this part of the whole package. It more or less mostly holds everything. Vacuum, batteries (yes, you get two), and attachments/tools. It is a pretty clean setup, charges the batteries, and it is great to have it all just “there.” One of my favorite parts of this package.

In use, I have found the vacuum very effective. Now, my space is rather small, but it is mix of hard flooring and carpet. It handles everything, easily. It has enough power for me in just the normal mode, which really helps with the battery, but the turbo mode works scary good. Now, it is pretty loud, but if only needed in short bursts, it is a non-issue. Perhaps if you need to use it a lot, it is something to think about. One thing I have really also liked is being able to quickly just detach and have a hand vacuum. This is something I have lacked, and it has been very useful. All in all, I have zero complaints about how it, well, just vacuums. It has been great for me. It works, it is easy to maneuver around, and can be used in several different ways.

I will also add, that while I am somewhat new to stick and honestly, nice vacuums, I also didn’t really have an issue with the size of the “bin.” It is quite a bit smaller than I am used to, but you can actually compress the contents down, giving you more room. Again, my space is small, so this wasn’t really an issue for me, but it is a nice feature, and really just kind of cool. Regardless, emptying the bin is an easy and clean process.

Given my space, this is, again, not a big deal for me in terms of getting my vacuuming jobs done, but I have to commend LG on providing two batteries with this vacuum (and the great charging solution). Per the stated ratings, admittedly in perfect conditions, you should get about an hour per battery. So, things like using some attachments will drain a little faster and using Turbo mode will drain a lot faster…but being able to use one battery and then just swap in the other is just a fantastic add. Those with large spaces and/or big jobs should be covered. I just wish more companies and sectors thought like this.

Ultimately, I really like this vacuum. It does all I need it to, and it does it well. It has an excellent storage solution, and “range” is not a concern. It’s built well, and I think it should last over time, which I think is important with something like a vacuum, but perhaps most importantly, it is just easy to use, and it simply makes my vacuuming experience better."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/11/2022 17:38,PsykoPup,Very Nice Stick Vac,"LG has created another great product. I already own an LG TV, as well as a washer and dryer. Consequently, I’ve already been using LG’s ThinQ app (for Android). Adding this stick vac to my WiFi and the app was very easy by just following the instructions in the app. One thing I feel is missing from the app is the ability to see a numerical representation of the amount of charge the battery has. In other words, I think it should show the battery level percentage. I only noticed this was missing when I wanted to see how much battery I used during one of my vacuuming sessions. I receive notifications from the app when the battery is fully charged. The app works well, but I honestly don’t see it as necessary. I don’t foresee needing to look up my vacuuming history or need to be “told” when the battery is done charging. Maybe if there is an issue with the vacuum would it then prove to be useful.

That being said, the vacuum works wonderfully. It’s very easy the switch between the included tools and I really like how it comes with an adjustable telescopic wand. I’ve owned quite a few stick vacs and this is the first one that comes with a wand like that. Other than the wand, the other tool that I use a lot is the crevice tool. We have a Golden Retriever and his long, feathery hair is all over our floors. With past stick vacs, when I try to vacuum up his hair, the vent on the vacuum inevitably ends up blowing his hair away. It’s actually quite frustrating. With this LG stick vac, that does not happen and it’s very appreciated.

One thing I found a bit wonky is how the crevice and combination tools are stored on the stand. As I mentioned, I use crevice tool a lot. On the stand, there are 2 spots for storing the tools. The front spot is for the combination tool, and the cleaning brush is stored up inside it. The back spot is for the crevice tool. Each tool snaps into the spots and there is a release button to remove the tool. The release buttons face the front. I’m detailing this to convey the fact that pressing the release button to remove the crevice tool is somewhat difficult. There is not much space to get your finger in there to press the button. It would have been better to place the release button, at least for the crevice tool, on the side so it would be easier to get to.

We have a 3100 sq.ft. home, with hard wood floors, rugs and carpet. I’ve been able to vacuum the entire house on a single charge. On the hard wood floors and rugs I use the standard power level; on the carpets I kick in the turbo mode. A single full charge of the battery was able to handle all that without running out of juice. Very impressive. If by chance the battery does not last for a vacuuming session, there is a backup battery that was included. It’s stored away in the included charging stand ready for use. 

One unique feature of this vacuum is the “Kompressor technology”. While this is a great feature, I would not label it as “technology”. It should be called a “Kompressor button” because that’s exactly what it is. When the container gets full, you manually push down this button to compact down the debris, so more can fit in. Again, a very handy feature, but the name hints that it’s an electronic or automatic function.

All in all, this is a great vacuum. It has a very long battery life, with an extra battery to spare. It does a very good job vacuuming on hard flooring as well as rugs and carpets. There are a few “quirks” but I would definitely recommend this vacuum."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/7/2022 14:58,Mizshutterbug,THE LG CORDZERO CORDLESS A9 IS GREAT!,"Received the LG A9 and it was a fairly easy assembly out of the box. You simply do 2 clicks and then insert the battery on the vacuum itself. A detailed instruction sheet is included showing you how to access the LG ThinQ app. I signed up with the app and registered it. You click on ADD A DEVICE and place the product information in there. Please note that this app has to be used on a 2.4 GHz network and will not work on 5GHz. For me personally I do not have an automatic switching router so I decided that after the initial run I wasn't going to be changing out my router settings as you don't need the app to run your vacuum. The app basically tells you battery life, cleaning history, filter info, etc. but I can also look at the vacuum and see the same. It IS a convenient feature if you have an easy router change up. It works splendidly without the app however and I am pleased with that.

My model came with charging stand, 2 battery packs, a crevice tool, soft brush tool and a cleaning brush tool for the bin. It has the Universal Nozzle power head which was fine for all my needs here. I charged it overnight but have since only had to charge it a couple hours for the battery to be ready again. It's quite nice to have that second battery ready if needed but I haven't had to use it. I clean my 3,000 sq. foot  house using the Normal mode and one charged battery lasts. I do not use the Turbo or Power Modes as my floors are mostly laminate with 3 rooms of carpet and I found the vacuum was more than adequate in Normal. I did try Turbo and Power modes out briefly but the noise level is pretty loud so with my sensitive ears I found the Normal perfect. You can use the included charging station free standing or they include mounting hardware for attaching to a wall. They also give you an extra washable filter, which is nice. 

I love the fact this can become a portable handheld unit by just removing it from the stick. It worked wonders on my carpeted steps heading down in the basement. I had been thinking about buying a handheld for that so it was certainly a real plus to have this feature. 

As far as the battery running times LG says you will get about an hour of cleaning time in the Normal mode, which I did. If you choose the Power Mode it should last about 20-30 minutes and the Turbo mode drops you down to 6 or 7 minutes. Of course you do have that extra battery waiting but as mentioned the Normal mode is perfect for my needs. 

After cleaning the dust bin will need to be emptied of course and it's so simple and efficient! You just push down on the Kompressor lever and everything easily comes out. No more using my hand to grab stuck remaining dust out of the bin! During use you can also compact the dust by sliding the lever down several times. On my older stick vacuum I had to empty that bin about 3 times so this was another feature I really enjoyed on the LG. The cleaning brush that's included you'll want to use around the Kompressor plate to clear away debris. I always clean out the dust bin after every use to keep the suction at its highest level. Be sure after you wash the filters they are completely dry before inserting back. LG suggests waiting 24 hours so they are not damp in any way.

All in all I found this vacuum to be an excellent choice from ease of use to its cleaning ability. I like that fact it's not too heavy or bulky and has convenience features I really like. I can definitely say I'd recommend it if you don't mind not accessing the app if you just have a 5 GHz network available. As stated, it works perfectly fine with or without the app in my opinion and makes for a most easy cleaning experience. Fantastic design job on this vacuum LG! I love mine!"
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,9/7/2022 17:40,FlyingC,"Not perfect, but pretty great","I have an earlier model of the LG CordZero that I've been very happy with, and this new one so far is just as good. There are a ton of things I like about it and only a few things that aren't perfect, but it's still my go-to vacuum for quick clean ups around the house. 

The charging base is sturdy and makes it really easy to grab the vacuum for use and drop it back in the slot for charging when it's done. I rarely have to switch to the second battery, but if needed it's right there in the stand always charged and ready to go. The run time I get out of a single battery is usually more than enough for me to hit the main areas in my downstairs (at least 15-20 minutes). I also like that the stand has a place to keep both attachments so they don't get lost. When I grab the vacuum to go, I usually pull the crevice tool off and slip it into my back pocket so I have it when needed.

The telescoping floor brush is another super convenient feature. I'm over 6' but when it's fully extended I can vacuum without having to stoop over. Then, when I'm doing the stairs, I can shorten it until it's just the right length to clean the steps as I go up. I can switch out the roller head with the crevice tool to get the edges of the steps, as the roller doesn't get all the way to the edges most of the time.

The ""kompressor"" technology is also a game changer. The weak link with most stick vacuums in my house is they fill up really fast with pet hair and I feel like I'm constantly emptying them. With this one, I can shut it off for a second, push the lever down to compress all the hair/debris to the bottom of the canister and then start vacuuming again. I can now do large areas without having to stop and make a trip to the trash can to empty it out. Anything that saves time is a big plus in my book.

It's easy to empty out when you're done. Usually pressing the lever down will make everything drop out, but a couple taps on the side of the trash can will get anything that tries to stick. I also pull the filter out of the top each time and tap it into the trash to clear most of the dust off. Then every few weeks I'll wash that filter and let it dry for a day and it's practically as good as new. 

It does have a wifi connection so you can add it to your LG ThinQ app with other LG appliances, but I haven't found that to be particularly useful for anything. After I'm done using it and put it on the charger, I'll get an alert later that it's finished charging. I guess that's nice, but really isn't necessary. Maybe it'll alert on other conditions if something happens to it, but I have yet to run into that situation.

There are a couple of things about it that aren't perfect. One is the suction is a little on the weak side, especially if you have the stick extended all the way. I find myself using it in the ""turbo"" mode most of the time and then it picks everything up. It's noisier and uses more battery in that mode, but still acceptable. The other thing it does is sometimes leave a little line of dust/pet hair on rugs from the back edge of the roller head. There's a little strip of material like a short cloth brush on the trailing side of the roller. As you're vacuuming and pull it towards you, it apparently gathers the debris. Then when you roll forward again it leaves the line of dust/hair on the rug. The solution for me is to always vacuum rugs by working your way backwards. Then at the end you can clean up that little line of debris. 

So, it's not perfect but like I said it's still my vacuum of choice for cleanups in between major vacuuming with a corded model. It's light, easy to use, holds a lot of debris, and has a good long battery life. For me, that overcomes its weaknesses."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/11/2022 8:37,Alex,"Excellent stick vacuum, with some sneaky features","Here is yet another stick vacuum on the market; however, hold on for a second....this one has some things going for it.

What's in the box:  Surprisingly, a lot.  The box is fairly small, but whomever was in charge of packing the box obviously is a world champion Tetris player.  I mean this in a good way since there are quite a few things included.  Two batteries, charging stand, brush head, and two crevice cleaners are included.

Setup:  Although there are quite a few parts, setup was fairly straightforward.  You click together the stand, click together the vacuum and insert the battery(s).  You can then set up wifi, if you want, to get a few more features.....most of which I don't use...more on that.

Use:  Overall it is fairly straight forward...it is just a stick vacuum after all.  There are a few things, though, that I really like.  One of those things is the two batteries.  If you really want to get your clean on, you simply swap batteries when the first one dies.  The second battery charges in its own spot on the charging stand, so both are always charged.  I will say, battery life is what you would expect with a stick vacuum.  It's not like they included two because the one.....sucks (see what I did there?).  The buttons are easy to use.  Push to turn on, and then use the other two to change the suction power.  You can hold the ""plus"" sign one for a few sections and turn on turbo boost; however, this will cause you to go running for the second battery fairly soon after....but it is very powerful for a stick vacuum.  

Unique features:  Besides the two batteries (see above), there are the wifi features, the extendable ""tube"" and a little flappy pushy doodad that helps empty the dust container.  The wifi features are..neat...but I found after setting it up I don't use it.  On the LG Home app you can see the charge status, how long you've used the vacuum for, and a few other stats.  Nothing that I found very useful other than ""oh thats neat"".  The extendable tube I both like, and dislike.  I like because it makes the vacuum compact and easier to store.  What I don't like, is that the button/slider you use to extend the tube is a little quirky.  It sometimes took me a few tries to get it to extend.  That dirt container thing?  I LOVE.  You open the bottom of the container and push down on a slider that pushes all (most) of the dirt and hair right out and into the trash.  No more digging in and going on a hunt trying to empty it out.  

Overall:  I really like this stick vacuum.  Besides the extending tube quirk, I love everything else about it and that quirk is not enough for me to give it 4 stars rather than 5."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/7/2022 17:42,TechNinja,A Strong Performer!,"The LG Cord Zero is a great option at this price point when you compare it to other vacuums in the price range. It has some positives and some flaws as most products do. Anytime you go with a cordless vacuum you will have compromises. However, none of those outweigh the glory of not needing to find an outlet, manage the power cord while vacuuming, and rolling the cable back up. It has changed the way we clean at our house. We vacuum far, far more often now. We never reach for the dustpan and broom either. It’s just so easy to use. 

Pros:

Its very light weight while feeling solid. When using the vacuum, you never feel fatigue. The material choices are excellent. The main shaft slides up and down very easily for adjustment. The dust bin opens in a way that makes it as easy as possible to land the dust into the garbage bin without spills. The stand that comes with the vacuum is very convenient. I did not want to wall mount, so its nice that LG provided a solid solution for a less permanent option. I like that the vacuum doesn’t use a trigger to turn on/off the vacuum function unlike one if its competitors. Instead, it’s just a button located in an easy to press location on the top of the handle. There’s two main modes, normal and turbo. On normal the vacuum feels like the usual for a cordless vacuum. Weak compared to their corded counterparts. That’s ok because that’s literally every cordless vacuum on the market. The most powerful cordless vacuum cannot match the most powerful corded vacuum. However, the LG Cord Zero does have a nice way to get close to the power of a corded vacuum. Turbo mode. With turbo mode, the vacuum achieves very high levels of suction. It will run out of battery quicker in turbo mode, which is to be expected. The last pro I have is the fact that it comes with two batteries. A cordless vacuum with one battery is not the best situation. Luckily, this kit comes with two!

Cons:

There aren’t many cons. It takes a bit of getting used to putting the vacuum in its stand. For a while it will feel difficult, but you get used to it after a while. It could be designed better I feel. The last con is that there aren’t that many attachments included in this kit. It would’ve been nice to get one more vacuum head included in this kit. I went on LG’s website, and they have some cool options to purchase separately, so at least you can get more if you are willing to pay extra.
 Ultimately, the LG Cord Zero is a strong performer. It boasts a useful turbo mode. It feels great to use and is lightweight. It comes with two batteries, and they last a good while. The attachments that did come with the vacuum are useful. You can’t really go wrong at this price point with the LG Cord Zero."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/12/2022 11:45,rtbestbuy,Great Addition to a RoboVac Home!,"The LG-CordZero Stick Vacuum with Kompressor technology is a great addition to a robovac home. We live in a house with two dogs who shed and insist on bringing the great outdoors inside. With wood, tile, linoleum and carpeted surfaces, as well as furniture, we added a robovac to the family to try to keep up. RoboVacs are a great 90% solution, but there are still corners, behind doors, furniture, and just the odd spots to vacuum. A rechargeable stick vacuum is a great idea, but most that we tried either just didn't have enough vacuum, capacity, or battery to really work well. The other problem with a 'cordless' is that you have to charge it somewhere, you can't just stick it in a closet. The LG-CordZero solves these problems in a compact, easy to store package.

The LG-CordZero has a very nice charging stand that hides in a cubbyhole nicely (see picture). LG provides a hideaway second battery that can be swapped and charged while the vacuum is in use. The basic vacuum is sufficient for dust, fur, and dirt, and there is a boost and turbo mode for really dirty stuff. It's also great on furniture and blankets. It comes with a 'beater' head, crevice tool and brush attachment which pretty much covers any surface you need to clean. The 'neck' adjusts to accomodate the height of the user.

Setup was a breeze. It literally took us longer to get it out of the box than it did to get it clicked together to use. The instructions are clear and concise. It is WiFi connected, but I found that to be marginally useful. It's not required for operation.

The 'compressor' technology actually works pretty well, at least for fur and dust. There is a lever that you press and it pushes the gunk down into the bottom of the 'gunk' well. Since none of these stick vacuums have much storage, it allows you to empty it much less frequently. It also makes emptying it much easier because you open the bottom, flick the lever a couple of times and it pushes the gunk out the bottom.

All in all, an excellent addition to a robovac home. It would be welcome in a smaller home or as an alternative to pulling out the corded vacuum to vacuum a room or couple of spots. Highly recommended!"
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/7/2022 21:36,Titan5178,LG Made it even Better!,"I had the older version of this same model and really liked it. This one is even better as the battery runtime has been improved to 60 minutes from 40. There’s still enough suction at regular power that I hardly need to engage the power or turbo mode for any reason. With the included extra battery I can do the entire house while another battery charges in the docking station. 

Another difference is the old model included a hard floor and a carpet attachment. This one just has one universal attachment to do both. I think this approach is much better. I’ve had no issues using this all-in-one attachment to clean both my tile and carpet. It also includes a combination tool that can be used to clean your car or if you use it on the end of the telescoping wand I’m able to get random spiderwebs out of the corners of my 10 foot ceilings. The Power Punch tool has a vibrating feature that allows it to aggravate the dust and debris and remove it from upholstery. There is a 5-step filtration system so there are several filters: a prefilter, 2 “cyclonic”, metal, and fine dust, all of which are both easy to remove and washable.

My old model also did not feature the “Kompressor” technology which compacts the dirt and hair so that it both stores more and is easier to dispose of. It provides a Kompressor Lever that you can utilize while vacuuming to force the dirt into the bottom of the dustcup. I find this to be a valuable new feature because I constantly had to use my finger or remove the filter to get all of the dirt out of the old one.  

Pros:  

High Performance 
Not that noisy 
Includes 2 batteries 
Washable filters 
1 large attachment for all floors 
Multiple smaller attachments 
Kompressor technology 
Wifi enabled 
Docking station can be placed on floor or wall mountable 
10 year motor warranty (1 year general)  

Cons: 

None! 

Overall, this is an excellent cordless stick vacuum and I have no hesitation recommending it to anyone. The increased runtime and extra battery give you two hours which should be enough to cover an average or even large home."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/8/2022 10:45,ZachC,Stand Out Cordless Vacuum,"Really impressed with this LG vacuum. It has great suction on our carpet and leaves clean lines. It also works great grabbing crumbs against the baseboards in the kitchen. There are three modes of suction and you just need to press the power button vs holding the trigger like other stick vacuum brands. While turbo mode runs the battery down faster I have yet to run out of battery life before finishing the job. The grip on the back of the handle is nice but I do not really care for the piece inside the handle by my index finger.   While a slight inconvenience, you quickly become used to it being there.  The Kompressor technology works great to make more room for dirt and helps with emptying. It is lighter than other stick vacuums I have used and I like that the stand holds all the attachments and spare battery so you do not have to find another place to store them.  This vaccum has made it fun to clean in our house and its easy for our kids to grab off the stand and use when they need to clean up a mess.  The stand also charges the both batteries so its always ready to go when needed which is really helpful.  The app has a self-diagnostics tool that I have not used yet but may come in handy in the future.  Overall, very happy with the ease of assembly, performance and battery life of this new model from LG.  Highly recommend!"
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/8/2022 22:07,Derek,LG Continues to Impress with the CordZero,"I’ve owned the first two generations of the CordZero. My wife uses one of them to keep her classroom vacuumed, I keep one upstairs, and this new one downstairs. While I wish it came with a bare floor attachment, the hybrid floor attachment it does come with does a sufficient job on the wood floors I have downstairs while also working well on the carpet on the stairs.

Battery life has improved with each iteration of the CordZero, and it is impressive. I have a 3,000 square foot home, and I rarely need to swap batteries while vacuuming from one end of the house to the other. Plenty of suction power, something the CordZero has always had, while also being lightweight, relatively quiet, and easy to clean. Yes, the CordZero can be pricey. But you get the stand, an extra battery, an extra filter, and all the attachments you need to keep your floors clean. 

The CordZero can also be connected to the internet, but to be honest, I have little to no desire to do so. LG doesn’t need to know how often I use their vacuum or when the filters need to be cleaned… But the CordZero functions just fine without the internet connectivity, and I highly recommend it as a high-end, very capable cordless vacuum."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/12/2022 0:33,Sean,So nice I got it twice.,"The LG CordZero stick vacuum is perfect for quick clean ups or for use in small areas. This is actually my second one of these vacuums and the first is still going strong after three years. We have one dedicated to the upstairs and the other mainly stays in the RV. The battery life is more than enough to clean the entire RV. With the addition of the second battery, that is always topped off in the charging base, there is also more than enough life to clean all three upstairs bedrooms and the common area. The Kompressor feature makes for easy emptying of the canister and in the event of picking up a lot of dog hair it can be used to compress it down to continue vacuuming. The telescoping wand is not only useful for saving storage space, but it is actually super useful for when the kids need to do a quick clean up. It's the perfect height for our 8 and 10 year olds. Cleaning the vacuum itself is also a breeze as the filters are easy to get to and the internals of the canister break down very simply.

Lightweight, powerful and easy to use and maintain."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/15/2022 8:30,Matt,Unbelievable Vacuum,"I have so much to say about this vacuum and its all good things.

This vacuum is extremely impressive. It comes with a stand, wall charger, spare battery, two separate attachments and a spare filter. The battery lasts quite a long time (I am not sure as to how long because I always keep the device plugged in when not in use. The stand holds both attachment pieces so they are not hanging off the side of the vacuum (like most vacuums). You can adjust the power of the suction on the vacuum which is great. The vacuum while on full power is not also that loud. The suction on all levels is also very good on hardwood floors and carpets. I am a huge fan of how compact the vacuum is. When not in use it's not very tall so its quite compact in a closet. It does of course extend out when in use so not to worry. Aesthetically its a very nice vacuum but don't but a vacuum for aesthetics alone, buy it because it functions and performs well. I highly recommend anyone buy this vacuum for any cleaning use. It's well worth your money."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,9/10/2022 13:15,82jax,"Efficient stick, needs balance.","The vacuum stick has great suction on both hardwood and our area rugs.  It does have some issues trying to pick-up larger debris, but a lot of this is toys you wouldn’t want to be trying pull or dig out later.  It would be nice though in the dining area to be able to grab those larger crumbs at times.  The battery seems to last for quite a while allowing me to get through the entire house and re-touch any areas that need extra attention where there’s high foot traffic from our kids; eating and play areas.  This is in normal mode and switching between batteries after about an hour of use.  Overall this is a good vacuum for everyday light cleaning that is easy to operate and easy to unclog and clean.

An advantage to this is the free standing base for charging and storing the vacuum vice having to hang it on a wall.  Plus having the option to store most attachments to the stand and not having to find a place with others to store the additional accessories.  Just kept readily available what I would use daily and more often for those deeper cleanings.  I did find during use that it did seem a little unbalanced at times in trying to keep it on track with where I was trying to get it go."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,3,9/9/2022 13:06,TheStump,Expected Way More From This Vacuum,"I expected way more from this LG stick vacuum. While it does clean up fairly well, there are several issues that keep this from being a great stick vacuum. 

Positives first: it is lightweight and compact, has good suction on high, really good suction on turbo, and does a mostly good job picking up dog hair, dirt and dust on most surfaces. The charging station is awesome and dual batteries assure that I can vacuum my whole house and basement without having to recharge (about 3700 sq feet total). I like that the whole unit extends to accommodate my height but also allows easier use on stairs with the shorter length. Possibly my favorite feature is the Kompressor that allows you to compact what you pick up in the canister. This feature allows for a greater capacity as you can compress the stuff in the canister so you don’t have to empty as often.

What keeps this unit from being great are the many negatives: Low speed is mostly useless. I have to use high or turbo to pick everything up off the floor and rugs/carpet. It struggles with larger solids. I believe this is due to the suction not being strong enough. There is no light. For a model at this price point I expected a bright LED to light up the floor. Even much cheaper stick vacuums have this feature. The suction is super weak with the vacuum extended and no attachments. More attachments should be included for the price but they are only available to be purchased separately. 

I would not recommend this vacuum and would suggest anyone looking for a stick vacuum to look elsewhere."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,1,9/6/2022 12:03,Austin,Poor suction,Does not pick items up well. I regret this purchase completely. Always feel like its on low power mode. I push items around too often and it does not pull them up becauce it does not have the power. Would not recommend
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,2/2/2022 15:57,JStigT,Lighter than Dyson?,"Could not choose between Dyson V15 and the LG Cordless. Decided to go for the LG because I feel like Dyson is much heavier when holding. Also, LG does not need to keep pressing on the power button when using (which is different than Dyson, and I find the LG much more convenient). However LG does not offer as much cleaning head option as Dyson, and hard to buy accessories as well."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,1/25/2022 10:37,Jonathan,So far so good.,"PROS: 3 speed settings. 4 accessories and a cleaning brush. Having a backup battery is awesome but I barely need it. It makes cleaning easier. I like that you don't have to hold the button (like the Dyson's). Flexible head makes cleaning hard to reach places easy and helps body fatigue. 
The swipe down helps knock out dirt when emptying. Easier to empty then Dyson. Beautiful design w Charging stand that fits seemlessly in the house.

CONS: It doesn't like picking up items over a certain size with the main head; for example Cheerios might give you a hard time. Taking apart the powered main head should be easier because you will need to clean it especially if you get some water+ dirt in there. You have to have a secure place to put your stand or you risk knocking over you very expensive machine."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,3,1/18/2022 15:23,Sarah,Only allergy friendly if you don’t have to empty…,"Thought I was going to love this vacuum, as I have allergies to dust and it has a hepa filter/allergy certified.  However, unlike my dyson that empties everything without any extra help, straight into the bin with no messy filters to clean, this one is not that way at all.  Even using the compressor function to help the dirt out, I find that much of the dirt and hairs (probably about half) stay stuck in the top portion, and worse, there are crevices at the top where it collects, and the entrance from the stick to the canister is on the small side.  So because fur, dirt, and hair collect in those crevices, it often blocks the intake with normal routine vacuuming.  This is very difficult to clear out. Even when that part isn’t blocked, I typically have to either reach in to pull it all out, or attempt to knock it on the trash can which makes dust go everywhere.  And bc of the makeup of the big plastic filter inside, just the friction of the dirt going past it makes more dust go airborne than my dyson does.   And then also the filters collect a ton of fine dust which you periodically need to clean.  I love that it doesn’t make my allergies flare up while vacuuming, but unless you have someone else who can empty it for you and do it outside, then be prepared for it to affect your allergies each time.  And because the bin is small, I have to empty it every single time I vacuum.  

The other downside is that for some reason, after a couple of months, the motor head will now sometimes sound like it is rattling, even when there is nothing in it.  It seems to still work fine, but it is noisy and annoying to vacuum a whole house with it rattling so loudly.  

 I LOVE the extra battery as I can vacuum almost my whole house on them, but I run a bit short because for carpet you really need to use the higher suction settings.  

And while I thought it was doing great picking up pet hair by the looks of things, the other day I set a lint roller down where I had just vacuumed really well, and was sad to see that much more pet hair was collected than I would have thought just in setting it down.   I’m not sure this should be listed as pet friendly or allergy friendly.  If you don’t have allergies or pets and don’t mind the way it empties, it is a handy vacuum that I really wanted to love."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,4/16/2021 18:39,Norma742,Great so far!,"I’m really liking this product from LG. I was in the market for a new vacuum because my cordless Bissell PowerLifter had about all it could take. I bought the Bissell on a whim for around $100 because I needed a lightweight, cordless vacuum for my new home. (Single mother of two toddlers here with rheumatoid arthritis and severe back pain from a broken vertebra in 2011.) Let me cut to the chase and say this LG vacuum FAR exceeds the Bissell I had been using (duh!). It is made incredibly well, you can tell the whole design was carefully thought out. I had no idea LG made a vacuum until visiting Best Buy.com and seeing it in the suggested products row while viewing an extremely pricey cordless Dyson. The Dyson had my initial interest but I don’t like the fact you have to continually hold down a button for it to be in use. I couldn’t see myself having to  continuously press a button during operation and my hand/arm remain comfortably pain-free. This LG is absolutely perfect and exactly what I was looking for. It is lightweight enough, cordless (2 batteries = 120 min run time) and I like the fact that the stand doesn’t have to be mounted to the wall and will charge both batteries. The turbo power option is where it’s at! Picks up every little crumb stuck close to the baseboards. Only minor detail is having to self adjust the length with each use since it only fits on the charger in one position. That is really not a big deal to me. I love LG products and this one has been no exception so far! Bought the 5 year protection plan because of the price of this vacuum lol. (Had to justify spending so much money!) Overall I’m satisfied with my purchase and look forward to years of performance longevity. (P.S. it does have HEPA filtration and is “allergy friendly” per the British Allergy Foundation.)"
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,9/18/2020 15:46,nayadk78,Bit heavier than dyson,I specifically picked this model because the tool for bed is included. However it doesn’t include the tool for only hard floor..
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,3/21/2022 17:37,iamluckyb,"Help, I’m addicted to vacuuming!!","Alright guys, I’m not going to hide my enthusiasm— this vacuum has sent me spiraling into some sort of vacuuming obsession because I absolutely love this thing!! I have literally vacuumed every day since I purchased it a week ago; I’ve sent photos and videos of it to my family and friends; and am now planning to get my mom one. Before you start planning the intervention, let me tell you why this vacuum is so amazing and why you should have one as too!!

(My caveat to all these statements is that I live in a less than 900 square-foot apartment that is primarily low pile carpet and tile.)

This is my first cordless vacuum so I have no real basis of comparison, but I can tell you what I was looking for in one— something relatively lightweight with decent suction that I could use to run around my apartment daily as I have a small dog and live in the desert, which means hair buildup and dust. A useful hand vac. I was also interested in something that had pairing technology with an app or something that advised me when I needed to clean something order replacement part, etc.

As I mentioned above, I have been using this vacuum to clean the entirety of my apartment every day for the past seven days. I have used it primarily on the standard power (vs turbo) and have yet to go through one battery fully. I have only used the turbo function while using the hand vac. I have joked with my family that I am both fascinated and mortified at how much is in the canister daily!! Either I was living in a garbage can prior to the purchase of this vacuum, or someone is actively dumping dust and hair all around my apartment at night while I’m sleeping.

Pairing with the app was relatively easy and an added bonus for tech nerds like myself who like gadgets and apps and things of the sort. Registration of the product was also easy with several options to do so including online camera camera, and traditional mail in form. 

My absolute favorite part of this vacuum is the fact that the top can come off to become a hand vacuum. The added attachment for furniture or pet hair, however you want to see it, is nothing short of outstanding and has been an absolute game changer for keeping my couch clean. My dog loves to lay on the couch and it gets hairy literally daily. I can run this vacuum for a few minutes every day with absolute ease and I just love it!!

Suction and pick up have been fantastic both on my low pile carpet and tile flooring,

Overall, I like this vacuum significantly more than my corded Dyson. It is 100% easier to use, ergonomically better, and user-friendly. I will be interested to see how it stands up over time once the filters need to be cleaned and such, but thus far I am absolutely pleased with this purchase. 

While the Kompressor Technology may not necessarily be worth the extra cost, I did purchase the model with this option and have to say it is kind of cool. If the extra cost isn’t a huge factor for you, I would say get it.

Attached is a photo of vacuuming I did today and last night after seven days of vacuuming every day. I am so happy to know that this vacuum will give me a cleaner home when I am keeping my screen doors and such open during these cooler months. 

Get one and I promise you won’t be disappointed!!"
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,1/16/2021 12:29,JJFab8,Perfect Vaccuum For Townhomes,"I've been wanting a stick vacuum for years. I was dead set on a Dyson because it is one of, if not the best, vacuum brands. However, when I went looking during black Friday sales, the LG models caught my attention. Not having to hold the on button while you use it is wonderful. I love the telescoping wand gives you adjustable length. The portable charging station gives multiple charging setups without drilling holes in the wall. Having the ability to connect to WiFi and have diagnostic as well as usage history is wonderful. It evens sends a notification to the app on your phone when it is finished charging. Multiple batteries was a deciding factor as well. Turbo mode is useful but obviously runs your battery down faster. The power carpet/universal nozzle works fine on hardwood and tile, but the sold separately hard floor nozzle will probably work twice or thrice as well. All in all, I am thoroughly happy with this purchase!"
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,6/5/2020 20:43,KMiller,"Small, but mighty!","Super impressed with this vacuum! Initially going into using this, I assumed this would be more of a secondary vacuum for me, to use for quick surface vacuuming. But, by the end of the 1st week of using it, I can honestly say this vacuum is the real deal! 

Initial setup of the vacuum was easy. LG provides a quick short cut set of directions to get everything set up in the included Maintenance Guide. I love that this vacuum comes with a second battery and that the charging station was designed to hold and charge the spare battery, while also charging the one in the vacuum. I was also impressed that LG provides you with a second reusable filter for the vacuum. Although I did not choose to mount the charging station to the wall, a wall kit is provided with the accessories needed to do so. Right now I’m just using the stand, which is of sound design itself. The bottom of the stand is perfectly weighted to maintain a stable base for the vacuum. In addition, the stand has built-in places to hold all three of the additional, included vacuum tools, along with the cleaning brush. 

The vacuum itself is sleek in design and super light. The telescopic wand is adjustable to a bunch of different lengths, which makes the vacuum very versatile. The two nozzles and three vacuum accessories all fit the vacuum with or without the telescopic wand too.

 After letting the batteries charge fully, I first tried out my new vacuum on the hardwood floors in my house, and the first thing I immediately noticed with this vacuum was how quiet it is – it’s unreal! In addition to it running MUCH quieter than my corded vacuum, I found the Power Carpet Nozzle head to maneuver very well, and very smoothly as I vacuumed. (It easily fits between chair legs and turns on a dime.) I started with the vacuum running in the Normal mode, and then primarily used the Power mode for the majority of the cleaning. After vacuuming all of the hardwoods in the house (kitchen, dining room, living room and main hallway), the rugs, plus the laundry room (which is linoleum) and a small area of a bedroom – in order to test it out on carpet and run the battery down while in Turbo mode– I had a full canister. I couldn’t believe how much was picked up!  My corded vacuum has impressive suction power, but I have to turn off the rotating brush when vacuuming non-carpet floors and it doesn’t always quite get everything vacuumed up. The LG CordZero basically licked the floor clean in comparison.

Emptying the canister is oddly satisfying, and the Kompressor feature makes it conveniently easy to dispense the contents into the trash. I really appreciate this feature on the canister since the compact size of the canister results in the vacuumed contents getting wrapped around the filter and wedged between the filter and the wall. When this happens with my corded vacuum cleaner’s canister, I have to hit the side of it to get everything out, which subsequently results in stirring up some of the dirt into the air. The Kompressor on the LG CordZero vacuum eliminates this problem completely and is a much welcomed feature to keep the dust from becoming airborne again. 

For my next test run I decided to try out the Power Punch Nozzle to tackle a cover on a chair that one of my cats loves to sleep on. For this test run I attached the nozzle directly to the vacuum body, without the telescopic wand, making it handheld. I was VERY impressed with the Power Punch Nozzle's ability to pull up all of the cat hair that had been embedded on this chair for nearly a year! I alternated between it and the Combination Tool and it got all of the cat hair out within 5 minutes or so. This Nozzle is a pet lovers dream! I already own a handheld vacuum that is meant for vacuuming pet hair off furniture and it doesn't even come close to how easy and quickly the Power Punch Nozzle on this vacuum cleans. 

Last, after being unexpectedly impressed by the power of this vacuum I decided to test using this vacuum for all of my carpeted rooms in the house on the Turbo mode. Not only was I able to vacuum all 3 bedrooms and the hallway on one battery, the amount of dust and dirt this vacuumed pulled up was very comparable to my corded vacuum. I couldn't believe how well it did with the carpet!

Overall this vacuum is extremely impressive! It is very versatile in use and shockingly powerful for its size, but very quiet. It's easy to handle and very light weight, and between the longevity of the 2 batteries included, it easily meets the power-time needs for most houses. All around a great addition to any household!"
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,6/4/2020 12:06,Raiders,Better than a Dyson,"I've been using the LG CordZero for about two weeks to clean up various day-to-day messes that occur with two young kids. Overall this is a good alternative to the Dyson V7 that I had just prior to the LG, and it would be a better value IF the pricing would come down a bit or you find it on sale.

Pros:
The comfort of the handle and not having to constantly squeeze a trigger is awesome. It seems like a small thing, but not having to constantly hold down a trigger while vacuuming is amazing once you experience it.
The capability to easily swap out the battery for a fresh, fully charged one is HUGE and it changes your experience when using a handheld. On my old Dyson, once the battery died, I was done for at least a couple of hours while the battery recharged. Now I can simply swap out the battery and finish my vacuuming. Plus, all these rechargeable batteries eventually stop working, and it's a much easier proposition to replace this design vs. the Dyson.
Having three suction settings are great for when you don't want to fling fine dust and debris all over.
The ""Kompressor"" feature is an interesting way to make up for a small dust bin. It also speeds up emptying the full container and minimizes the amount of cleaning necessary when emptying the bin.
I really like that the entire machine practically can come apart to facilitate cleaning.

Cons:
The dust bin is small. The Kompressor feature helps to extend the capacity, but it's still small compared to my other vacuum. 
The LG feels much heavier than my previous Dyson, even though the total weight is not that different. The weight distribution is much more ""top heavy"" feeling compared to the Dyson.
The air exhaust blows straight up from the top of the unit. Depending on how you're using it, it could be blowing straight in your face.
The extendable floor arm feature is of little value. I'm concerned at some point it might break and will make the floor attachment useless
The design of how the wall mount screws go into the wall makes it impossible to use anything but a manual screwdriver to attach the plate to the wall unless you have a very long, narrow screw bit attachment to your drill.
The dust bin lid has a small hook on the end that unfortunately catches a lot of dirt and hair when you empty the bin. It's also not a ""touchless"" design like how the Dyson is designed, although the Kompressor feature does help mitigate this.

The WiFi feature is interesting, but I don't think it really adds anything necessary. It it nice getting notifications of when the vacuum is finished charging and seeing how much time I spent cleaning. Perhaps it will automatically notify me when I need to clean the filter, but it hasn't yet."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,6/1/2020 21:20,Dakingindanorf,Excellent Cleaning System,"The LG Cordzero is my first cordless stick vacuum and overall, I absolutely love it! 

Here’s the things I like about the vacuum:
- The vacuum and accessories are beautiful. So much so, I almost didn’t even want to use it and get it dirty, but alas. 
- Setup is really easy with clear instructions and accompanying images. 
- The vacuum has a small footprint. It easily stores in smaller spaces and corners where you barely notice it, but it’s always at the ready. 
- Using it is straightforward with three buttons that allow you to turn it on/off, toggle between the three power modes (normal, power, and turbo), and monitor the vacuum via WiFi and the ThinQ app. 
- This thing is versatile with the included extendable wand, power nozzle, punch nozzle, brush tool, and crevice tool. I have zero issues cleaning hardwood floors, carpeting, rugs, trim, furniture, and under appliances. 
- It’s also light. I can easily wield it one-handed. 
- Both batteries charge at the same time with one in the vacuum and the other in the stand.
- Battery life is excellent. I am able to clean my partner’s 800 sq. ft. apartment in power mode with one battery. I can clean my 1,700 sq. ft. townhome in power mode with both batteries with juice left over. That’s using a mix of attachments to clean from top to bottom. 
- The entire cyclone system and filters can be removed. Filters are washable, minimizing replacement costs down-the-road.
- The Kompressor system pushes dirt and dust down inside the dustbin, allowing you to clean longer before having to empty it. Thought this was a gimmick, but it actually works well. 
- We have a Beagle running around. This vacuum picks up short dog hair with ease. I love that I can just grab the vacuum off its stand for quick touch ups seeing as his shedding is constant. 

And the things I don’t like so much: 
- While having a vacuum that can give you usage information and help you diagnose problems is nice, it’s also a bit unnecessary. This is a vacuum cleaner, not a car. 
- While the Kompressor system works well most of the time, sometimes dog hair gets stuck in the cyclone system. When you push the Kompressor down, hair sometimes gets above it and requires manual cleaning. Not the worst thing in the world, but can be a nuisance. 
- It would be nice to have a way to connect attachments to the vacuum body instead of carrying them with you separately or running back and forth to the vacuum’s stand to swap them out. 
- I find normal mode to be a bit weak when it comes to suction. I run the vacuum on power mode at all times. 

These minor flaws do not detract significantly from my overall thoughts on this vacuum as no product is going to be perfect for everyone. I think this vacuum hits enough marks to be a really great addition to anyone’s home cleaning routine!"
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,5/31/2020 18:44,CTmom,Light weight-easy to maneuver,"Let me start my review by saying that vacuum cords are the bane of my existence. I fight with them constantly- run them over with the vac, pull them out of the wall by accident when I am trying to stretch and reach that one last corner- so when I saw this cordless unit, I had to try it. 
It is super lightweight but very powerful. I like the two settings- regular and turbo. I mainly use the turbo. It has some awesome features: It comes with 2 batteries so you don't have to buy the spare (as many cordless items require you to do). Because I am not limited by a cord, I have cleaned corners of my house that have not been done in quite a long time!
 It has a cool ""power punch"" nozzle for bedding. It doesn't spin- it beats the bedding which loosens up dog hair and other things in the bed (cookie crumbs??). My dog's hair doesn't even come out with washing and hanging the sheets on the line! This is the ONLY thing I have found that gets the hair out of the sheets and comforter. Because it punches and doesn't spin like a beater bar, it does not get the sheets caught in the unit. Love it!!
I ran it on a single charge for several days using it off and on. I let the bin get very full and still had strong suction. I like the ""Kompressor"" (sic) lever that packs the dirt and dust down so you can fit more. Emptying is super easy. 
The only downside I have found is that it did not work well in my car. In its defense, my car is REALLY dirty with a lot of small rocks and pebbles. 
I was able to vacuum up cobwebs on my porch- a place I could never bring my corded vacuum cleaner.
Of course, it is wifi compatible and has an accompanying app called LG thinQ. With the app, you can check charging status and length of use. Cute addition but not necessary."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,8/17/2021 21:58,jojokidmusic,LG Cordless with KOMRESSSOR - Works for me,"The plusses are that this can charge 2 batteries at once. So, it is not as heavy as the larger Vacuum cordless competitors.
powerful for the size and picks up dirt and dust that the larger one could not as well. And has the filers to get the dust we never saw before. I bit of a challenge to clean because of the dust inside.
Have to be careful with where you dump the dirt but all of these types haver the challenge. Has accessories and stand and all. These are expensive so I waited for a sale. Easily stored. Medium Sized. Was on sale or I wouldnt buy it."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,5/29/2020 23:36,softwareEngineer,Small Design Details Make Big Impact,"Cordless stick vacuums have been synonymous to a certain brand we all know very well. Since then, there has been an influx of stick vacs from various manufacturers trying to match or dethrone the de facto standard, of which I do own a few of myself. But the LG CordZero Kompressor is a refreshing take on the stick vac, and it would be hard not to compare it to what I already know. So, I will point out the little innovative things that made me appreciate LG's solution with respect to my current stick vacuum. I'm actually surprised that LG had a line up to begin with.

Here is what I loved about the LG CordZero:

+ Removable Battery Packs - This is a killer feature. Swap 'em for more run time when you need it. Also, most batteries lose steam after a couple of years, and those built-in solutions require you to send your unit in for a battery swap. 
+ Longer Run Times - Each battery averaged about 30-35 minutes using the Power Nozzle, which I use mostly on normal power. LG does advertise 60 minutes per battery, but only if you're using the non-powered attachments. The batteries can be charged at the same time (one in the vac, one on the stand). In the future, my guess is that they will produce longer lasting batteries that you can purchase down the road. 
+ Telescoping Wand - You don’t realize how convenient this is until you’ve tried it yourself. Very useful on stairs. 
+ Very Lightweight - My current stick vac (a 2019 model) is heaaavvvy. The CordZero is very light, and it is especially convenient when used in hand-held fashion. 
+ An On/Off Toggle Button - That’s right. You don’t have to pull and hold a trigger to keep the vacuum running. No hand fatigue!
+ Kompressor - With this dirt compactor lever, it helps keep the machine small enough, yet allows for more dirt bin space. Kind of a innovative way to solve the bin space problem and keep the vacuum lightweight. 
+ Charging Stand Footprint - With the telescoping wand in the shortened position, the vac can be stored most anywhere without sticking out (and up!) like a sore thumb. It’s simplistic design also helps keep it inconspicuous in your home.

Here’s what I didn’t like:

- Very Lightweight - Wait, what? Well, since it is lightweight, I feel like the Power Nozzle is not “digging its claws” into the (carpet/rug) floor, if you know what I mean. I don’t have any scientific proof, but it’s just a feeling.
- No On-Board Attachments - You cannot attach any tools onto the stick vac. Well, at least I think you can’t. It’s kind of nice to have the tools you need right when you need them.
- A Trigger Guard - But no trigger? I think the grip would feel a lot more comfortable without the trigger guard there. No need to have it, in my opinion.
- Power Punch tool - I get the principle of its use, but I found myself continually smearing pet hair back and forth. A hand-held power roller would have been a better attachment, in my opinion.
- Power Nozzle clearance - I had problems getting the roller head deep underneath small clearances. I currently do not have this problem with my incumbent vacuum.
- A 3 bar battery indicator - I'm probably being nitpicky, but it would be nice to see a ""time remaining"" display on the unit.

But none of this really matters unless the CordZero actually sucks. Luckily, the suction power of the CordZero is plenty for the needs of most consumers. It has three settings (Normal, Power and Turbo) and I feel that you will most likely keep it between Normal and Power modes for the best performance/battery life balance. I’ve learned that I can keep it in Power mode for most of my hardwood floor cleaning with plenty of battery life with the spare in tow. That being said, you can find other stick vacs that have more nominal suction power and comparable run times at this price point, albeit without the outstanding creature comforts that the CordZero provides. So if suction power is your primary driver, pass on the LG. But if you're looking for a tremendously well balanced all around stick vac, this is definitely worth a look."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,1/15/2022 13:48,11-Mar,Lg vacuum,"Really easy to install, but the manual has various LG  vacuum models and  accessories which made it difficult to follow. The pictures also are small, so we not sure which accessories we had, until a few pages in."

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,6/4/2020 15:33,Woo151,70/30 Hard Floors and Carpet House. Love it,"The LG Stick Vac came as a huge surprise to me. As I have always been a ""traditional"" regular vacuum guy that plugs them into the closest outlet to use, this LG has spoiled me to death.

Right out of the box, assembly was quick and easy. Came with an assortment of different add-on tools for a variety of floors/cracks/crevasses. My home is roughly 1850 sq ft with mostly hard floors (tiles) and some carpet for 2 bedrooms. After assembling the stand I put 1 battery in the stand itself and one in the vacuum and mounted it. Charging both took about 2 hours.
The stand itself held all the attachments except 2, the cleaning brush (unless I am blind and can't find where to hang the little guy) and the Power Punch Nozzle. (See pic)

While charging I downloaded the app and set up WiFi, yes the vacuum has WiFi, and noted how plain and simple it is to use. The app will send a notification to your phone/tablet letting you know the Vac is fully charged. Also it gives you info on how many times you used it and total run time. It's a neat little feature. I included a pic of how it looks. I think every time I take it off the stand it ""counts"" as a use, but I am probably wrong on this. The pic was me waiting for it to charge before using it for the 1st time and setting up the WiFi. 

On to the Vac it self. It is compact, lightweight and 100% fully adjustable and can customize it however you see fit. I am 6' tall guy and have no issues using it comfortably. You want short? take off the wand or leave it as is. You need it longer? Stretch out the telescopic wand up to 2 times to the length you need. It turns into a hand vac if you need. Just pop off the attachment on it and clip on the other. I love how easy it is to just change-and-go. 

On hard floors, I would give this a 7/10 rating as sometimes, I notice that it will PUSH some of the debris away instead of sucking it up. Remedied by either picking up the vac and placing it on top of said debris or changing the attachment to a crevice tool or something. But that defeats the purpose of making your life easy, right? To each their own as it didn't bother me too much. 

On carpet, this vac sucks! In a GOOD way! Stuff my other vac missed, it picked up that I didn't know was there. All in all I used the Regular setting and 1 fully charged battery gave me ~50 minutes even though they said 1 hr? But I think it's because of the WiFi also using some power. Luckily LG gives you a 2nd battery! Popped the replacement in and threw the 1st on the charger and went to work on the beds and sheets. The power punch tool is a nifty little thing as it ""vibrates"" stuff up of the blankets and boy, there were things in there. Food crumbs for your dirty minded people -_- I decided to try to the TURBO setting along with the Pwoer Mode setting and the battery gave me ~15 minutes from the mixed use. Also take note that Turbo and Power settings drain the battery like crazy and is LOUD. 

The Kompressor (compressor) is basically if you are not near a trash can to empty the bin. Honestly to me it's more of a gimmick. Yes, it works but it seems to let hairs and finer dust/debris into the ""walls"" of the bin and eventually on top of the Kompressor itself, basically making you clean it up anyways. It's nice in a pinch like if you are at the last stretch of cleaning to get the job done 100% 

By the way, the LG Stick Vac is AMAZING for cars. I cleaned out my whole Jeep in about 10 minutes just finding all sorts of filth to get rid of.

Pros
All around great Vac for ANY home.
Multiple attachments included to clean up everywhere.
Build quality is superb. Can easily lift up and go anywhere. Stairs? Bathrooms? Under the bed? Yes to all
Mountable to the wall for nice aesthetics
CORDLESS! Love it to death.
Battery Life - On regular setting.
Suction is great on carpets, beds, blankets and rugs. 
Weight - Almost 6lbs.

Cons
Price (ish)
Battery Life using Turbo (barely 5 mintues)
Hard Floors - debatable on what tools you are using. Reg attachment seems to like to push the stuff away then to pick it up.

Like I said earlier, I am spoiled by this Stick Vac and find myself not even touching the other vacs I have had for years.
Side note, this Vac has a TON of protective plastic on it, make sure you get it all off."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,9/9/2022 16:43,Amazing,Better than a Dyson,"In the past, I've had the Dyson v8, V10, and V11 and have had issues with every single one of them. Finally got this because it is similar to the Dyson v8 and I liked that style. This vacuum is much lighter comparatively and I like how it swivels to almost go completely flat to vacuum under furniture. Two batteries are great if you like to use it on high. The kompressor is also great to remove the trash. However, I don't like that this doesn't bring a soft roller head and I would prefer a motorized head on the mini tool. I don't really like that it vibrates although it works sometimes. A big negative is that this vacuum struggles with bigger debris because the inlets are smaller because of the telescoping nozzle. The app connectivity is useless. It just tells you how long it has run and will send you a notification when it is done charging."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,3,10/15/2022 12:07,Chipper,"Good, but not great.","I bought this product after extensive research into cordless vacs, and the results have been a mixed bag.

On hardwood floors and area rugs it does a great job cleaning up all sorts of debris.  It struggles just a BIT on area rugs on the higher settings, but it's not a dealbreaker or anything.  Emptying the vac is super easy, and probably the best I've ever owned in that regard.  Finally, the charging stand is very, very nice.

Now the lows...first and foremost, the ""punch"" tool was purchased to help clean my dog's hair from furniture, and I've found it to be pretty useless.  Very disappointed in that attachment.  Secondly, the ""turbo"" boost mode can't be used in handheld mode (to my knowledge) - just when the vac is fully extended.  Lastly...this is NOT a vac for carpet - especially with pets.

Bottom line, it's a fine vacuum, but it doesn't do enough to justify the steep price tag.  For hardwood floors and touching up/versatility it's fine, but if you're looking for a workhorse I'd suggest looking elsewhere."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,10/29/2022 15:20,gte770m,Like it so far,"We switched from Dyson, and I do like that you don’t have to hold down the trigger, but I suppose that’s personal preference. Definitely enough suction, spare battery is a plus and my parents have owned one of these (or a similar LG model) in Korea for years, so I am fairly confident about durability as well."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,6/11/2020 11:01,HoMi3,Better than anticipated,"I am coming from a traditional, bagless, upright vacuum. I had expectations that were set low since I couldn't see this small portable vacuum doing any heavy jobs. I was mistaken but happy to report that this thing can perform. First, I want to acknowledge the setup for this is extremely easy and efficient. Right out of the box I was able to build and start charging both of the batteries at once! I started to run the vacuum and the suction was impressive on turbo. I didn't need to have turbo on full time so my battery lasted a bit under 25 mins switching back and forth. The 2nd battery came in handy to go 40 mins on normal with decent suction. I have a labrador and this picked up hairs easily from my carpet and hard floor. I will say though that due to it's small canister size I had to empty out the trash a few times. No problem though since the filters are washable and I can see this being really easy to maintain. There is some dust that catches in the cyclone filter so just keep am eye on that clogging but gain, cleanup is a breeze. The app is neat to have, shows you cleaning history and tells you when it is done charging. Neat features to have."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,7/30/2020 16:28,SportsDuck,Initial 24 Hour Impression,"We had a Dyson break down (again) so we decided to give the LG CordZero a try. This was our first stick vacuum as we have only had upright vacuums in the past. We got lucky and caught on sale and an open box. 

We got lucky with the open box as it looked like it was never used. Set up was easy. We placed the charging stand but we will look to mount it if we keep the vacuum. We liked the fact it came with two batteries and a good number of attachments. You can purchase additional attachments through an add on pack LG has. 

We have carpet on our stairs and between pets and kids they have been neglected as the Dyson was too difficult to bring up and down the stairs. This was not a problem with the CordZero. It also worked well on hardwood floors, rugs, and our low carpeted  basement. Since it is a stick vacuum it did take longer but was overall effective. Battery life is good and it's relatively quiet. Material quality is excellent.

There are some minuses. The obvious one is how much dirt it holds. Coming from an upright, it's like I can sneeze and the canister is filled. It also clogged up a lot but I'm pretty confident once we go through the initial cleaning of the house with the vacuum this will be less of an issue.  Took me a few tries to figure out how to unclog it well, and that is taking out the dust separator and holding down the compressor lever. You got much easier access to where the dirt got stuck and easier to unclog. 

I saw a few review videos showing the vacuum had trouble with larger items than Cheerios. For me it was inconsistent but it was definitely challenged with items like the dry dog feed our retriever mix eats. Sometimes when you rolled backwards it worked better. Everything else though was great.

I know it seemed like I listed more negatives than positives but overall I'm happy with the vacuum. It's much lighter than our uprights which means getting it around the house will be a lot easier. Suction strength is very good.

Is it worth the price? Maybe not the $700 MSRP but if you catch it on sale it'll be worth it.

And again, this is a 24 hour review. I'll post again after a little more time."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,7/29/2022 16:21,Blt05,Best vacuum ever!!,I love this cordless vacuum.  It cleans so much better than my dyson and bissell.  It’s light weight and and very very quiet.  It’s the only vacuum that my dogs don’t go crazy over when I’m using it. I love that there are two batteries even though I never had to use the second battery.  The battery lasts for a long time.   I highly recommend it!
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,8/31/2022 14:22,Phillip00,Great Vacuum for Everyday Use,"What a great vacuum.  It has great suction power, great battery life, and is super easy to use.  Love being able to take it everywhere in my house to quickly pick up messes.  And the Wi-Fi let's you know when it's done charging."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,6/10/2022 16:44,jpozzzi,Great Cordless Vacuum,"This is my 2nd purchase of this exact product/model. First one died at around 1.5 years old. Fortunately, I purchased additional warranty protection plan. Company called it a loss and gave my purchase price back to me. We have tried other cordless stick vacuums, and despite the short life of this unit, comparatively, it's the better one."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,8/7/2022 13:11,Nikki,Light Weight,"This LG vacuum is as advertised. Don’t let the quiet sound fool you, it is very powerful when using turbo mode. This mode does make the battery run down faster but it comes with two to easily finish the entire house. Easy to carry up and downstairs."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,6/24/2022 19:31,Askme411,LG cordless vacuum,"I love love love my new vacuum! I have lower back pain so I needed a lightweight but effective vacuum that doesn’t take up a lot of space. This is perfect …. And it won’t void my carpet’s warranty like a Dyson or Shark (super atrong suctions destroy carpet fibers).
The only con is that you have to empty often but I don’t mind."

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,8/19/2022 16:05,Brian,Best vacuum for the money!,Great vacuum and very easy to use. Lightweight and works great on hardwood floors and carpet. Charging stand is great plus it comes with 2 batteries. Buy it amd you will be very happy!
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,6/17/2022 15:40,SecretGrape,Great Stick Vac,Love this vacuum. We had a stick vac that was corded and it was still a hassle to get out. This LG vac actually makes us vacuum a lot more. Its so easy to just grab real quick and do a quick clean. The battery lasts as long as they say it does and the turbo mode has a strong suction.
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,6/18/2022 4:49,NewRokuUser,Better Than Dyson,"I purchased this when my Dyson stopped working. So far, it has been more reliable than the Dyson. I really like the fact that it comes with a solid freestanding stand so I don't have to hang it on the wall. I wish it were cheaper though."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,7/8/2022 18:57,Happywiththebeats,Very please,It’s a great stick vacuum I really like the way it’s designed and how quiet it runs and it picks up dirt really well I like the way it’s maneuverable I can recommend that someone should buy it I enjoy it.

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,10/1/2022 19:42,Brian,Happy with Product,Easy to use. Lightweight and portable. Simple to clean.
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,6/19/2021 16:05,V3rnacular,Pretty Doggone Good Vacuum,"We really love this vacuum at our home. It's soo light that the kids can even use it. (Although its still a fight to get them to clean up after themselves) 

Pros:
- Lightweight and yet powerful enough to clean up the cat/dog hair, cereal remnants, and other enjoyable parts of life that kids and animals leave for you 
- The attachments are easy to store and the device itself is extremely modular
- Emptying the receptacle is easy and you don't even have to get close to touching the stuff inside
- It does everything we need it to do

Cons:
- It does not seem to have the same suction power as a larger, more traditional vacuum - That being said, it cleans every room in our townhouse in one go"
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,7/22/2022 18:39,mpryor22,Good not great,"We love it but it is a little short if you’re a taller person. Cleans great, doesn’t get under furniture that easy."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/14/2020 8:56,Mikepro,"Small, not cheap, but AMAZING","I was a bit skeptical of this vac. I got it as part of an appliance package deal where I needed to get one more LG appliance to get 10% off of everything, so it was kind of ""free"". Before using it, I don't think I ever would have considered spending this much on a cordless stick vac. But this little thing is great! So light and maneuverable, and it picks up great. It's way easier to use than my very expensive Sebo airbelt D4, therefore it gets used way more often. I really don't even need that other vac now! This is so easy to use on stairs, take downstairs, use for dusting, couch crevice cleaning, car. I have hardwood and tile floors, with rugs, and this does an awesome job on all. The 2 batteries are super nice, basically never without a charge. Anyone hesitating at the price or worried about performance - don't! This thing is awesome. My only complaint is emptying dust bin, some gets caught on the lip and you have to shake it a bit to get it in the trash."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/17/2021 18:52,vk3o,Happy,"My Dyson of 4 years finally broke on me so I figured it was time to get a new vacuum. Upon my scavenger, I was in-between the LG or another Dyson, but I really liked how the LG came with a stand, as opposed to the Dyson where I had to mount the charging station to the wall. Another plus for me was that I didn't have to hold a trigger button while vacuuming -- just push the button and it's on, 2 clicks for Turbo mode. Also love how the arm extends and retracts! Bought it while it was on sale, and I'm glad I did!"
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,8/28/2022 22:50,Alex,Good vacuum,Good vacuum that is probably on par with a Dysons.

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,11/12/2021 16:20,Luann,Love it!,I used Dyson for several years but recently switched to LG CordZero. I love this vacumn so much but I really wish they had the all in one tower where they suck the dust out without removing manually. Please get them soon!!
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,3/19/2022 16:20,Christine,Love it,Absolutely love this vacuum. It’s pricey but I think it’s worth it.  It did get clogged once and I had to take it apart.
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,5/13/2022 15:38,Santhosh,Performer,Sobfar its been great. Does well both on carpet and hardwood.
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,9/18/2020 15:59,sandybair,Great - unless you have pets,"Really impressed with this vacuum.  Unfortunately, the Power Punch nozzle that comes with this vacuum for cleaning furniture does nothing for picking up dog and cat hair.  I can see where it would be great for picking up dust buried deep down, but I still had pet hair all over my furniture with this.  I tried using the floor nozzle and just removing the extension, but there's no way to lock the floor nozzle in place for this purpose (unless I'm missing something).  I was super impressed with the looks, features, low-noise, extra battery, etc., but I had to return this and go with the new Dyson v11 Torque Drive instead.  If you have pets, I'd recommend the Dyson by far!  That thing is a beast!  If you don't have pets - this one would definitely be my pick though.  It looks more expensive than the Dyson, isn't nearly as loud as the Dyson, you get an extra battery with the LG, you don't have to hold down the power button the entire time with the LG, and cleaning is an absolute breeze."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,6/5/2020 10:06,Sean,Great little vacuum,"Very pleased with this vacuum. Quite powerful when on turbo mode and great build quality on the accessories. The spin brush is great on low pile carpet and rugs, does well pulling up dog hair without getting tangled. The kompressor lever is super handy when emptying the bin and I've even used it a time or two to compact the picked up dog hair so there is room to get that last little bit before having to empty it. I have the vacuum wall mounted and I like this top load mount over the type used by others. This is a pleasant upgrade from my Dyson V6 which is about the same size, but doesn't feel nearly as powerful. I do wish it had mode memory though, having to cycle through the modes every time you use it is a minor annoyance."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,11/20/2020 15:14,nycom2003,Excellent,"Excellent.  Works well.  I chose this over the other brand because it has interchangeable batteries, you can charge one while using the other; and because it has an on button.  You don't have to hold the trigger to use it. Suctions seems adequate.  Stand is great."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,5/17/2021 12:00,Manny,Loved it but returned it,Loved it was perfect for our bare floors downstairs and carpeted upstairs. Ended up returning it because we didn't think the Kompressor part of it was worth the extra $200 . Ended up getting the basic model instead for less money and same performance.
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,12/9/2021 14:59,chunx972,"great buy,","it does the job as advertised, love the 10 yr warranty on the motor ,
very satisfied with the purchase and the performance of turbo mode."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,9/15/2021 22:58,Rudy,Love it!,"I decided to give this a try since I love my LG washer and dryer. It has some cool features that I haven't seen elsewhere. The vacuum feels sturdy and well built, especially when comparing to how cheap and toy-like Dysons can feel and sound (that creaky/flimsy plastic). This is AAFA (allergy and asthma) certified, and has a sealed system, which was very important to me. I have a dust mite allergy and asthma. The ""Kompressor"" tech is pretty cool and helps reduce how often you have to empty the bin. It also helps push the bin contents out so you don't have to touch any of it. One thing I think is really brilliant, you use the crevice tool to remove and clean the cyclone. This means you don't have to reach in to grab it and dirty your hands.
Another super cool feature is the stand/mount. It's very sturdy and can charge the extra battery at the same time the battery in the vacuum charges. It makes a cool sound when you dock the vacuum to let you know it's in all the way. You don't have to drill into your wall with this stand/mount. Lastly, the ThinQ app wifi connectivity is not necessary, but it's cool to see that it can help diagnose any issues, has helpful info on cleaning the filters, as well as when to clean them. Connecting to the app has another cool feature that can notify you when the vacuum is fully charged, so you don't have to keep checking on it if you are waiting to finish vacuuming. It comes with 2 batteries, and on the low and medium settings, it can last from 40-60ish minutes on one battery. On the turbo setting, about 7-8 minutes per baattery. My only gripe with this vacuum is that it can be a little hard to push over carpet. However, the carpet comes out very clean, and I see that it's able to get very fine dust from the carpet as well. No tangles or difficulty picking up my dogs hair (2 huskies). The wand is extendable, which is convenient. I highly recommend this vacuum. Another thing I like over the Dyson stick vacuums is that you just press a button to turn it on. There's no trigger you have to continuously hold like the Dyson stick vacuums. This vacuum does feel a little heavy if you're holding it up for cleaning above head areas, but it's not that bad."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,11/6/2020 17:16,Hitman,Excellent cordless vacuum,"Excellent vacuum for small to medium carpeted floors.  Picks up dirt and hair good.  Easy to empty, comes with a brush to clean the dirt compartment, but I use canned air to clean it better (outside, of course). Stores away in a small space, so not in the way when not in use."

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,8/2/2021 14:47,VacuumWizard,"Compliments Corded Vacuum, Doesn’t Replace","Great vacuum…..BUT!  I’ve been researching this vacuum for quite a while.  I waited for a slight price drop, and finally bought it.  Here’s my thoughts….

THE GOOD: Build quality.  This vacuum feels great in your hand. It’s lightweight, easy to maneuver and nothing about it feels cheap. This particular version comes with multiple accessories that make the vacuum versatile. Love that it comes with a spare battery, as battery life is probably what kept me from buying a vacuum sooner. The ability to charge the spare battery, and the battery in the vacuum at the same time is a big bonus.  I also love the stand that comes with it. I was skeptical about the “punch tool” which vibrates instead of having a spinning brush for the mini cleaning head. That being said, in my limited use it worked well.  

THE BAD: Suction power.  This is literally the only thing I don’t like about the vacuum.  Most reviews I watched or read said that it had good power, but that wasn’t my experience.  In standard mode the suction was weak. It pulled hair and dirt up out of the carpet, but it didn’t even make the carpet look like it had been vacuumed.  What’s the point of vacuuming if it doesn’t leave the pattern in your carpet to prove it!? Seriously though, it seems powerful enough to get the obvious debris left on the surface of your carpet, but not powerful enough to deep clean.  When turbo mode is engaged, it seems to have merely adequate power, only problem is battery life as the battery only lasts 8(ish) minutes on turbo.  

THE CONCLUSION: This is a great vacuum if you have hard surface floors throughout your home.  In my opinion, I wouldn’t use it as the only vacuum in my house as I don’t feel that it has enough suction to replace my corded vacuum.  For that reason, I will be returning this vacuum and getting the Dyson v15 (which, I already bought and is much more powerful.) That being said, this is a great vacuum when used in the correct setting.  No complaints about the vacuum, just not powerful enough for what I was looking for."

Cons: only 2 holders/hanger for the tools, no 3rd holder/hanger or storage bag for power punch noozle.  Suction power is similar to some of those in the hundred dollars range. Over-priced optional accessories that includes a power punch noozle which is already included in this model A927KGMS.

This comes with 2 batteries, so it has plenty of vacuum time. I use this vacuum for small dirt and debris and it does a surprisingly good job. It is very light and easy to maneuver around the house. The small attachment is used for sofa and bed and it is somewhat of a miss. It does minimal punching to agitate the surface. Overall, I think it does a good job for being a vacuum."

We bought this to replace a handheld vacuum because we wanted something longer that we didn't need to bend down to vacuum along our hard wood floors/linoleum. It is an expensive vacuum but compared to our other expensive vacuum (Dyson Animal) this one out performs anything else that we've owned. Giving the ease of use a 4/5 because in order to use the highest power setting you have to hold the speed button down for 3-5 seconds. The low and medium speeds are easily accessible by simply pressing the button. It's a minor inconvenience that doesn't seem bad at first but does get aggravating when you are waiting for high speed to start. Also, the app is pretty much worthless. Only reason for the app is to keep track of ""use time"" but our app constantly stops tracking the vacuum and you have to ""re-sync"" the app with the vacuum to get the ""use time"" working again. We usually don't bother resetting the app because we don't see a reason to keep track of the vacuums usage time."

This has to be the worst handheld vac I’ve owned no suction power at all compared to Dyson. After owing multiple dyson handheld versions from v8 animal to the cyclone V10. I will be returning this for a new Dyson.

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,3/19/2021 20:46,breplum,Great vacuum,"The vac is well made and has great cleaning power. 
The Kompressor mechanism for compressing dirt is a step saver in reduced trips to empty the canister.
We had the non Kompressor model and returned it to Costco.
Frankly, LG shouldn't even offer the non-Kompressor model.
There is an updated K model announced at CES January 2021 but so far, no sign of product availability or pricing...it has a docking station to receive and empty the dustbin trash each time you dock for charging."

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,3,2/11/2022 19:03,LG12054,Being generous in my Rating,"Overall a mediocre product, one of the few times I’m glad I just didn’t start breaking down the box it came in and trashed it. The main cleaning roller attachment used for daily cleaning isn’t very agile and feels like it’s skipping across both a no to low pile  type area carpet and hardwood floors. It’s doesn’t feel like it’s gliding across the floor and pulling dirt and pet hair as it passes by it. As many previous reviewers have indicated wait before you put the stand together  and decide if the product is right for your home. The smaller attachment that would be used for furniture is literally useless , hard piece of plastic that oscillates in stead of spins , barley touched cat or dog hair from furniture.  Ended up using the main cleaning attachment to do the job, overall versatility is not there clean your car seats or floors.  Not exactly pleased at this price point. The only positive I have is 2 batteries , and a simple on off button beyond that I have nothing else to offer.  There is a reason it’s only garnered a 4.5 rating overall , I’ve given it a 3 where I believe this product truly should be and boxing it back up."

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,10/11/2020 21:42,ThePaleChipAndDale,Love the cordless portability,"This is an amazing vacuum, albeit at a price point that many, including myself, feel is a little too high. I have a Roomba i7 that runs Monday through Friday, but I also have three dogs that shed quite a bit. So even with the Roomba running a lot there still tends to be dog hair around the house. I love that I can grab this LG vacuum and just walk over and suck it up. No plugging anything in or looking for the nearest outlet. It is light-weight and decently powerful. Keep in mind I do not use this vacuum to clean the whole house. It is mainly for getting into areas where the Roomba is unable to or cleaning over the weekend when the Roomba does not run. It comes with some nice attachments including one that punches fabric to release dirt. For my family's use this vacuum is a great addition for our cleaning regimen and it's portability makes me more likely to grab it quickly when I see dust bunnies around the house."

I got this because it was on sale and had more useful features than what came with a dyson. So glad I got this! It cleans amazingly, is so quite, and easily is able to clean my entire house on one battery. This IS a great vacuum and highly recommend as an alternative to dyson. If I could change anything, I would of bought the LG vacuum that came with the power mop attachment. But overall, this is a great product and you wont be disappointed."

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,12/20/2020 15:29,Mike,Expensive and not for everyone.  But I love it.,"Battery vacuums are not for everyone.   The power is not going to replace your cord.   But I tried Dyson and the LG.  Either must have the largest battery.  And you will not live without 2 coming with the package.  That said, the LG in highest power is competitive to some corded.  The canister and filter was far better than Dyson.  The charging station charges both batteries.  A must feature.  And in the end the user friendly non cord makes sweeping easy.   I did have a concern with one battery not charging consistently   It has appeared to be user error when docking."

Since it's light, powerful and cordless I save a ton of time vacuuming.  Going from rooms with hardwood to carpeted rooms is a breeze.   Canister is small however it doesn't bother me."

What really impressed us was the incredible amount of stuff it picks up.  It completely outperforms the Hoover Lynx we used for quick pickups - as opposed to regular maintenance when I wanted to avoid hauling out the Miele canister
However, this mighty mini LG, with a HEPA filter, is now my go to vac.  Handy, well designed attachments are easy to use
Be forwarned that there is a bit if a learning curve as the weight is more upwards at the handle, rather than at the base, so it took us some getting use to.
However, its quite manuverable and very quiet.  Spendy, but well designed & worth it!"
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,10/30/2020 15:11,vikeking27,"Whole-home, powerful, cordless vac",Maybe the best cordless vacuum in the market right now. With the 120 minute run time across two batteries and the ability to compress the contents in the dust bin - you can easily vacuum your entire home - both carpet and hard surfaces with this - no cord required. Suction is very powerful. The only ‘con’ is that the carpets are not as fully agitated by this as they would be a traditional corded multi-brush/roller vac.  High quality construction and pleasing aesthetics along with a freestanding charging station make sure this will fit in somewhere in your home (can also be wall-mounted). Highly recommended - especially at a sale price.
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,2/27/2021 2:32,Hadrian,Great,"After a diligent research / comparison between LG and Dyson I decided to make this purchase and I am so glad I did. 

It’s such a great vacuum and has amazing suction power. I suffer from allergies and this device is so quick and efficient to pick up dust and really clean carpets. I did my whole bedroom and I’ve never slept better! 

It’s lightweight, customizable, and has two batteries that can be interchanged. Has more suction power than the Dyson V11 and it’s honestly way better looking in my opinion. 

I love my cordless vacuum!"

Super lightweight and easy to use. 

The sucking power isn't as strong as my corded Dyson but it does the job for my hardwood floors. Also, because it's so easy and fun to use, I find myself vacuuming much more often. 

Only con is that it seems useless on rugs. It'll get the debris on the uppermost layer, but won't give it the deep clean that a corded vacuum does."

This vac is way quieter and seems to perform better.  The Kompressor function is awesome for compacting the debris to increase capacity, and for easy cleaning of the bin.  And the second battery that charges in the storage base is genius!  We never run out of juice."

It switches between floor types seamlessly, even the stairs. It has good suction and the charging stand is great. The bin doesn’t hold as much I would like, but since it is easy to empty, it is not a big deal. Also since it is easier to handle and quieter than our old vacuum, the kids can help out more."

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,11/21/2020 14:01,Alex,Superior to Dyson in many ways,"Seems like quite a good vacuum. I replaced my Dyson with this because the battery life on it was shot. I did purchase this today and used it immediately, so I don't have a lot of time using it. I can't validate the claim of a 120 minute run time. It's very quiet compared to the Dyson. Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because there are four attachments but only two storage slots on the provided base station. Just a quirk. Overall a nice unit. Also it's extremely convenient getting an extra battery. Didn't get one with the Dyson. Didn't get a base station either, just a flimsy wall mount. If you're between this and the Dyson, I'd give this one a shot."

Se thinks this is the best vacuum she has ever owned (she has owned several). This is light weight, charges quickly and picks up every thing. Turbo is the best to pick up every tiny particle. With two batteries there is no problem doing the whole house."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,4/2/2021 15:47,Davey,Super vacuum,Awesome vacuum.  I own 2 dyson and 2 room a. This vacuum is very powerful and last a long time on one battery. Charges up fast and has a nice stand included. I prefer the LG over all of them as it is super easy to use and strong. Replacement parts are in expensive.
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,6/4/2020 18:26,Orion,Powerful and lightweight but not for hard floors.,"I’ve been using the LG CordZero A9 S for a week now and have been mostly impressed with the vacuum cleaner. This isn’t my first stick vacuum but it is my first LG vacuum cleaner. I’ve owned other LG electronics and have always been happy with the quality and performance. My washer and dryer are LG and they’ve been running great with absolutely no issues for almost 5 years now! I know LG is a good brand and I was excited to try their vacuum cleaner.

Upon opening and unpacking the box I was immediately impressed with the build quality. All parts and accessories look and feel like they are constructed with high quality, strong yet lightweight materials. Along with the included accessories you also receive an extra battery, an extra pre-filter, a brush for cleaning and an optional mounting kit. Unpacking and setting up the vacuum and stand were a breeze. LG included a thorough owners manual along with a separate LG ThinkQ connection guide and a two page waterproof maintenance guide with a suction cup to hang it nearby. And if that’s not enough there are many helpful tutorial videos produced by LG available online. I love that LG makes every effort to ensure people can easily learn to use their products.

I really like the look and functionality of this vacuum cleaner. It looks high-end, is ergonomically designed, lightweight and easy to use in tight spaces. I love the charging station and floor stand. The charging station allows you to charge both batteries at once while the vacuum is docked and you can easily swap out batteries if it runs low while you are using the vacuum. Also, you can receive a notification from the LG ThinkQ app when the battery is fully charged. The floor stand is weighted so that it doesn’t tip over easily. When docking the unit the signature LG melody plays, which I also love. :)

Overall I’m happy with this vacuum cleaner but I do need to mention that from what I understand by reading the user’s manual, and from my experience, this is not a good vacuum for hard floors. I’ve watched videos where people say a hard floor, soft brush nozzle is available but the owner’s manual doesn’t mention this part anywhere. The two large included nozzles are the “Power Carpet Nozzle” and the “Power Punch Nozzle”. The owner’s manual provides the following instructions regarding the Power Carpet Nozzle; “Use this nozzle to clean carpets or rugs. *If used on hard flooring, this nozzle will be noisy.” Although I don’t find it to be overly noisy on hard floors I do think it misses quite a bit, including larger debris such as cereal or dog food and is not very good on edges or corners. On carpets, the nozzle works beautifully and out of all the vacuums I’ve ever used, this one has the least tangles and build up in the brush. It stays nice and clean even though I have two dogs that shed quite a bit. No other vacuum has done that for me. The Power Punch Nozzle has been a delightful surprise. Instead of a rotating brush it uses a massage-like paddle that vibrates the surface to loosen dirt and debris with a micro brush stripe that pulls hairs from the surface. I used this on my dogs beds, our couch cushions, duvet and a large tufted ottoman, and on all three surfaces it worked great at pulling up the hair, loose feathers, dust and dander. I feel like the turbo setting really pulls the dander from the dog beds very well. The additional accessories are the combination tool and the crevice tool. These are fairly standard and come in handy for cleaning a variety of things including pet hair out of furniture, mats and tight areas, especially when on turbo mode.

I’ve been very happy with the battery life but am glad that it came with an additional battery since you will need to change it if you plan to vacuum on the Normal Mode for much longer than 30-35 minutes. Turbo Mode will last you about 6-7 minutes, so use it wisely, such as crevices, corners or very dusty seat cushions.

The bin design works well and seems to store more dust, hair and debris than you would expect for a bin this size. With the built in Kompressor lever allowing you to smash it down and make more room in the canister for a longer vacuuming time. The bin release button is nicely positioned and works in a way that allows you to empty the bin w/o getting your hand dirty, pushing stuck dirt down with the Kompressor. If you have dog hair, you will probably still have to reach in and pull some clumps out, but not nearly as often as models without this compressing functionality. It’s innovative and works very well.

I’m a fan of the five step HEPA filtration system and the fact that the filters are washable. LG recommends cleaning the filters monthly but I think I will need to clean this more frequently than that. It really depends on how frequently you vacuum, how much you vacuum and how dirty your floors get between vacuuming. I suggest reading and following the cleaning guide and this product should last a very long time, with replacement batteries eventually of course.

I did run into intermittent power and/or cycling noises while vacuuming my wool rug the third day I used the vacuum. It eventually completely stopped working and I had to reference the owner’s guide to figure out what was wrong. I had cleaned all the airways but it was still clogged somewhere. Turns out the short human hair I vacuumed the night before, after my husband cut my hair, had gotten clogged in the air intake. I didn’t realize this until I removed the large dust separator filter, using the crevice tool, and lowered the Kompressor lever. Above the Kompresser was a mess of clogged hair and wool from the rug. After cleaning that area the vacuum has continued to function clog free since then.

I’m pleased with this vacuum and think it has a great overall design. It’s lightweight, powerful and has a cool and functional docking station. The control panel is easy to read and use and the app is interesting but more of a novelty. I am concerned about the air intake becoming clogged easily but only time will tell. I also wish this came with a soft roller for hard floors instead of me needing to use a different vacuum in those areas. I look forward to seeing more innovation and advancement from LG in this area of electronics and am excited to see what they come out with next."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,10/31/2020 0:12,CoolAlJ,LG knocks out Dyson with a one two punch!,"The powered brush head is better than the Dyson V8 Animal that I own and the ability to change batteries while also charging to one you just used up is fabulous!  We have dog hair and the power brush head does not get wrapped up with hair like our Dyson.  The LG small head that vibrates is not as effective as the mini-animal brush head from Dyson, but frankly we just still use the wide brush head from LG - more coverage and no hair wrapped around the head.  The pole is also adjustable in length unlike the Dyson so frankly we are very impressed with the progress that LG has made here.  I was able to get an aftermarket battery for the Dyson that we bought 4 years ago and so we now have the benefit of both vacuums.  The main attachment missing with the LG is the hard floor with rotating brush which Dyson has.  So Dyson has better variety in the head options, but the power of the LG main head isn’t on par with Dyson.  For now, we have the best of both worlds."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,1/7/2022 15:45,Bcandia,"Good, not great.","Good quality product, battery life extension is great compared to my Dyson, but downside is it gets clogged very easily and is not able to be broken down into the right pieces to get unclogged easily. The increased battery life is offset by a decreased ability to not get clogged. If you don't have animals with hair, this should work fine."

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,7/30/2020 14:37,Simba,Excellent first day!,"I received this item several hours ago and charged the batteries right away. After about 3.5 hours,  the first battery was fully charged and I cleaned my entire townhouse with that single battery. Vacuumed the carpet upstairs, vacuumed the hardwood and tiles downstairs. Used the punch nozzle for my bedding and dinning seats, used the attachments for my ceiling fans and I even vaccumed the staircase. Most was on low power but it did the job! Great quality, easy to assemble and cleans well. I had a Dyson upright and then a Neato Robotvac Connected recently. The Dyson was great but its almost 10 years old and extremely loud now. The Robotvac died in less than 2 years. Tried to replace the battery with a Neato brand battery but even with Tech Support,  it wouldn't hold a charge. So here is my new LG Cordzero A9 Kompressor vaccum  and it's impressive. My hand/arm is a little sore but it is a good workout. I know its early but I am really happy with this purchase. I just hope it lasts longer than the Neato."

We had two Dyson’s that both gave us issues, parts that had to be replaced frequently and eventually were outlived by their warranty and we are so glad we found this one. We’ve been using it for months now without any issues. WAY easier to empty, two levels of turbo-mode, WiFi capability and the lightest machine we picked up; our preteen kids use it often."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,6/1/2020 16:37,Keyan,"Good Cordless Vac, high price","LG has been making vacuums for several years now. One of their more interesting inventions has been the “Kompressor” technology – on larger corded vacs this involves a paddle that moves in the dust bin and compresses the dirt into a harder cake, allowing for both extra capacity before the vac is full and easier clean up when it’s time to empty the bin. This new cordless vacuum from LG also has the “Kompressor” tag on it, but does it provide the advantages of the corded version, and does this vac justify the high price? Let’s take look and find out.

In the box is the stand, the power head with an extending wand, two batteries, a crevice tool, a combination tool with a retractable brush, a cleaning brush for the vacuum itself, and a “power punch” tool for upholstery. A couple of snaps and the stand is assembled, and the same for the vacuum with the power head on it. Easy to put together. I like the stand – other brands either have a wall mount that needs to have holes put in the wall and isn’t very portable, or don’t really come with a stand at all. This stand is very clever – it has a bay below where the vacuum attaches to charge the second battery, spots for the tools, and room on the foot of the stand for the power punch head. I REALLY like that it can charge both batteries so they are ready to go. It only charges one at a time, (starting with the one in the vacuum, once that is done it starts charging the other in the stand automatically) but knowing that both are ready to go for a dirty day is very handy.

The vacuum itself is nicely laid out. It has three buttons – power, a - and a + button. There is also a battery indictor on the front, the Kompressor lever, and the releases for the bin and battery. Pressing and holding the - button turns on the wireless, because, everything needs wireless I guess. There is an app but it requires an account with LG. I don’t really see the need to see my cleaning history, and this seems like a thinly veiled data mining expedition that really benefits LG by sending them details of how consumers are using their vacs and not giving you much in return. But it’s there if you want to track if the kids were really doing their chores and vacuuming the house. Fortunately, that feature is 100% optional. Moving on, this vacuum has a power button and not a momentary trigger. The market leader still insists on a trigger and it’s difficult to keep holding it down for extended cleaning sessions or at certain angles, so I am glad to see a proper on and off control here. During operation, the - and + buttons decrease or increase the suction power. On the normal mode, this thing really can go for a LONG time, LG states 40 min with the power head or up to a full hour with the crevice tools, which is pretty crazy. I had a hard time running it down with the power head and it did a good job on hardwood floors and area rugs. Using the + button gives you more power but with reduced run time. Then there is Turbo mode. Pressing and holding the + button for 3 seconds moves this thing into turbo mode, where it sounds like a corded vacuum and the suction is crazy high. It’s truly insane, but so is the run time drop, the battery will last less than 10 mins in this mode so it’s only for extreme cases. On the normal modes this vacuum is very quiet (for a vacuum) and won’t wake up the house.

Having owned an LG Kompressor corded vac for many years, I found the “Kompressor” in this vacuum to not be quite as useful. It’s a manual lever that needs to be pushed down to compress the dirt. It does allow the debris in the bin to be compressed, and it also cleans off the holes around the cyclone area, which is handy, but it would have been cool if this had been powered or automatic in some way. It also doesn’t go all the way down to the bottom of the bin for emptying, and I’ve still had to reach in and pull out some of the pet hair dirt. At least it’s all right there and not hiding up high in the vacuum requiring an expedition to get it out.

The extending wand that is included with this vacuum is another feature that I found very useful. It keeps the vac shorter for storage and I found that the shortest setting is great for stairs, no need to bend over at the dreaded “stair angle” or be on hands and knees forever while getting the stairs clean. At full extension it was comfortable for me, a tall guy, to use on the floor. The power head is also not overly heavy and very maneuverable. The vacuum overall is comfortable to use for an extended time. The filters are also interesting, the 3 components, including the cyclone system, being removable to be washed. This lets you really get the system cleaned out to keep it at top performance. It also exhausts air up and away, keeping you from blowing air on what you are trying to clean or back at you. The power punch tool for upolstry is different from the turbo heads that are typically on a vacuum. It vibrates instead of having a power roller to “punch” the dirt out of whatever you are cleaning. It seemed to do a fine job, and it won’t get bound up in loose or long pile surfaces or wear on them as much as a spinning turbo head will do.

Overall, this is a very capable vacuum that has a number of features that make it easy to use and store. It has enough power for everything that should be encountered in a household and several user-friendly features. Being able to charge both batteries in the stand along with store the accessories without holes in the walls is welcome, as is the ability to tear it down and really clean it out. I also personally much prefer the toggle power button on this vac to a trigger that must be held down. The Kompressor technology, while not quite as useful as it is in the corded LG vacs, still offers advantages over not having it at all. Having two batteries in the kit along with the tools helps justify the high price of this vac, but it still feels like a lot of money for a vacuum, which brings it to the rating I gave it."

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,5/29/2020 12:28,teasten,"Great Suction, Whisper Quiet, Thoughtful Design, L","Being honest, I haven't owned LG products for some time. My last purchase was a computer monitor some years ago and it has long since been retired. It's also not the first company I would have think of for appliances. That has clearly been my loss because WOW WOW WOW. 

BUILD QUALITY
First, the LG CordZero is a well built but incredibly lightweight vacuum cleaner. Just unboxing it my wife was like ""I can't wait to use this"". In fact, she fired it up first and her comment was about how light and easy to use it is. For the record, we have a different brand stick vacuum and the LG easily comes in at less than half the weight.

BATTERY LIFE
We gave the batteries an overnight charge before putting it to use. What first struck me is the LG CordZero is not loud. You don't get the ""whine"" you get with other vacuums. I was concerned it might impact suction, but no such concern. It is as strong if not more powerful than noisier cleaners. I should also mention it has a HEPA filter which is now a priority 1 buying decision for me on any home cleaning appliance and LG thoughtfully include a spare filter.

In the box, the LG CordZero comes with 2 batteries and a stand. The battery life is outstanding, rated for 2 hours. we have been able to do our full home on a battery across both wood and carpet floors (about 90 minutes use). I think I would struggle to run the battery flat in our home but I do like the extra battery though, as it provides you plenty of time for a worry-free deep clean and you have a spare if you need it.

STAND
The stand is worth calling out because I had some reservations, but its stable, well-weighted at the bottom, and no risk of toppling. The charging unit can be wall-mounted without the stand leg if you wish. The stand also features holders for the accessories which again is smart thinking by LG. Too many stick vacuum makers give you accessories but nowhere to put them (so they just find themselves in a junk drawer). The fact the accessories can be access anytime and are all on the stand means I am more confident I will actually use the crevice tool.

KOMPRESSOR FUNCTION
One of the things that intrigued me about the CordZero was the Kompressor function. This is a lever that both compacts the dust in the vacuum champer but also essentially cleans the vacuum mechanism by removing stuck dust and debris. This is BRILLIANT and LG should be applauded for doing this. Other brands I have found myself having to get a screwdriver to pull apart and clean things properly, not the case with the CordZero Kompressor.

WIF and LG THINKQ APP
One of the things I was not sure about is LG CordZero Kompressor has WiFi. If you download the free LG Thinq app, you can connect to the CordZero via an app. It shows the cleaning history (so great for policing if your kids did chores) and has smart diagnostics if something goes wrong. In some sense, the WiFi and app is overkill, but it was easy to set up and has a good UI, and given this CorZero has a 10-year warranty, seems worth it for product news, updates, etc. All of which makes me more inclined to buy LG appliances in the future.

ONE MORE THING...
Final comment. When you put the vacuum back in the stand it plays a little tune... it's random but cool and I like that. It makes me smile. Honestly, this whole experience has made me a fan of LG - from design, quality, features, warranty, and general smart thinking. I would definitely recommend and LG is now at the top of my list for my next home appliance."

Real easy to setup and use. Depending on your situation, you may need to empty it often, but that's not a big deal."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,5/30/2020 18:50,MountainLiving,A vacuum from the not to distant future.,"I just received my LG Cordless Stick Vac a couple days ago and I'm a little in love. I'm not sure where to start, so let’s go to the very beginning.

 This might seem silly to comment on, but as soon as I opened the box I was impressed. The way the parts were packed was a thing of beauty. As a kid I loved the game Tetris and have always had an appreciation for efficiently and securely packed containers, be they boxes or trucks. It was very quick and easy to assemble and loved how the parts click together and are easily removed while being very solidly locked in place when assembled. The Instructions were very clear. There is a really nice quick reference guide to hold onto to remind you about cleaning, disassembly, and general operation. Once it was assembled and placed on the charging stand (it came partially charged but wanted my first run to have a full battery) to get up to full power.

 We don’t have wall to wall carpet but instead an assortment of area rugs, linoleum and hardwood. It worked like a champ on all surfaces. We have one rug that is like old school shag carpeting and it took a bit of effort to push over the longer fibers, but not too bad. The device is really quiet on the lower setting but still works pretty well. The collection bin is a bit smaller than I’m used too, but that too is well designed and easy to empty into a trash can. So that was the first run. We vacuumed the entire upstairs, over multiple surfaces, mostly on low power and were quite impressed. We found it easy to use, easy to clean, quiet and light. But then I wanted to experiment a bit…with turbo mode.

 I took it down stairs where I had just installed a new door so we had just vacuumed a couple days before with a pretty standard issue mid grade upright vacuum. This was an area rug with a short pile and about 6 x 10ft. So not that big, not that thick and recently cleaned….or so we thought lol. I went over the rug twice in Turbo mode and I was shocked at how much dust was pulled out...nearly filled the collection container! This thing is a such a beast in this mode its hard to believe its cordless. It does come at a price as you’ll drain the battery pretty quick but that’s not for everyday use. Id say that it’s more just an occasional deep clean kind of thing. 

 I don’t really have anything to test out the punch nozzle on. Our couch is fairly new with a cover so there was nothing of note to pull out of there. I did use it on a dog bed that was recently cleaned and always has a blanket over it and it still pulled a little dirt out of it. I then removed the extension tube and just went with the little crevice attachment and went to work on my car. It worked very well and so much easier than using a traditional vacuum. Its so small and light when used this way. By this point I had killed the battery but I was pretty much done, and still had a 2nd battery fully charged had I wanted to continue. Oh and I want to mention the charging base. It’s very well constructed and hides the 2nd battery in it so it’s always charged when you need it. It also comes with a wall mount option but I’ll stick to the base, it’s just so nice. All in all I’m very impressed with this device. Impressive engineering and design beautifully executed."

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,6/1/2020 20:20,GamerDad,Goodbye plug-in vacuums,"The LG CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum with Kompressor is our third try at a replacement for our trusty corded vacuum, and this one is a winner. This LG has all the vacuum power of its corded cousins and does so in a lightweight, easy-to-maneuver package. 

A repeated complaint about other attempts at cordless vacuums was the lack of suction. This vacuum has plenty and it leaves the carpets looking fresh all the way to the baseboards. The way it raises the pile is admittedly a very unscientific way to judge a product’s effectiveness, but this one leaves no question the carpet is clean. One look at the dust cup and the carpet is all it takes. Very impressive. 
 
The “Kompressor” designation comes from a nifty feature I haven’t seen before. There is a lever/slide on the right side of the clear dust cup. When the dust cup has filled up, slide the lever down toward the bottom of the cup and the vacuumed debris is compressed into the bottom of the cup. This process also cleans the internal filter screen leaving the unit ready to continue its cleaning mission. 

Upon opening the box, I was a little daunted by the sheer number of pieces in it but referencing the included quick setup card promptly put my mind at ease. Unpack it as indicated, and assembly is really remarkably simple. Turns out the hardest part about using the new vacuum was waiting for it to fully charge before first use. We left it overnight, but the manual says 4 hours per battery. 
 
The LG CordZero comes with two quick-release batteries, and the storage/charging stand accommodates the extra battery when not in use. It’s always ready if the battery in the vacuum runs out. If both batteries need charging, the one in the vacuum charges first, then the one stored in the stand. I vacuumed the whole main floor, stairs, the upstairs, and a good portion of the basement (about 2,800 square feet in total) on a single battery’s charge. Then I switched batteries and attachments and headed outside to do the cars. This vacuum, so far, performs beautifully and it seems there’s nothing it can’t do. I have zero complaints. 
 
On hard floors, performance is excellent. Over the years, I’ve just learned to accept that if I’m picking up some crumbs off a solid surface floor, they’re going to scatter beneath the beater brush and I’ll be chasing them or grabbing a damp cloth to thoroughly clean up. I dropped a slice of toast in the kitchen, crumbs went everywhere, and somehow the LG CordZero has cracked the code to picking up crumbs without scatter. It’s my second biggest surprise with this vacuum. 
 
The biggest surprise of this vacuum is how quietly it operates. We can carry on normal conversation while vacuuming without even raising our voices. I can hear the TV while vacuuming. Our nine-pound 12-year-old dog hides from the other vacuums, but he came right up to this one in operation and gave it a curious sniff. How many other vacuums can claim they’re “puppy approved”? It never really occurred to me how noisy our past vacuums have been; it’s just always been a fact of life. Life just got a little more enjoyable. 
 
My wife is kind of a clean freak, and it’s no exaggeration to say that she vacuums 3+ times a week. She has been unwilling to give up the power of her corded vacuum until now. She loves the LG CordZero, and we’ve finally found the replacement we have been looking for."

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,6/4/2020 16:20,Ebonovic,It sucks... and is just short of perfect,"So we have had no less then 5 different cordless vac's in the last 4-5 years.. and honestly I think this is the best one yet... I would give it 4.9 stars, and will explain why it isn't a full 5 stars. 

So let's start with some of the basics: It comes with TWO rechargeable batteries, so honestly if you use it right you should really never run out of power during one normal cleaning session. 

The charging base is pretty well thought out, but this is where I knock the .1 off. It holds the spare battery internally, and can charge both the vac and the extra at the same time. You can mount it to the wall, OR, it comes with a heavy base extension so this can sit up right. And it even hides the cord vertically. It holds the two primary attachments right on it, so they don't get lost. The .1 knock off 5 stars, is that there is one other attachment (large), that needs a home, and a small brush... would have loved to seen that on this base as well. 

Assembly takes just a couple minutes, but getting it all out of the box takes a good 5 minutes. 

After a charge, you are ready to roll. This Vac DOES connect to WiFi. It is supported by a simple app that will keep track of cleaning history (so you can bust the kids if they say they cleaned, but there is no history of it), and it will tell you battery life. Other than that, it is probably something that isn't really necessary... 

When you turn it on, if you have an LG washer/dryer, the tone is going to sound oddly familiar... it will take a while to get used to that. 

Now for the main function, as a vac... and it does it well. It is light weight (lighter then my Dyson), easy to move and maneuver... and it is relatively quiet... If you have light sleepers, they will be woken... but average sleepers my night even hear you use this. 

The canister is pretty large for a hand held, wouldn't ask for much larger. It has a plunger that will scrub the inside to get dirt/dust/hair off the air flow pieces, so you don't have to do it by hand. 

The extension arm, can be completely removed, so you can get small tight spaces, or you can adjust it to 4 different lengths, very easily. Very smart, and is great for a family when one member is 5ft and the other is 6ft. 

The power punch attachment is pretty interesting, we just gave it a test run and it does seem to do the job well for some stubborn dirt, and other areas. 

So the vac does do it's job and it sucks... but comes with plenty of extras...."

I live with two dogs and wall to wall carpet so I need a full powered vacuum to clean the mess. I've had other sticks and they can't handle it and this surprised me. I was able to clean my whole space barely using any battery. The canister needed to be cleaned often and did clog more than a few times. After figuring out how to remove the internal metal filter, it was easy to clean but definitely required some fingers or the cleaning brush to remove the stuck fluff. The screen cleaner was a nice feature as well, but I felt it allowed for sorry to get into the upper section of the canister which was then harder to remove. I'm happy to be able to replace two vacuums with this one unit, but do wish it came with a powered mini brush for hair etc. that I could use to clean my car."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,4/1/2022 16:16,Familyof4,Great vaccum,Love this vaccum it’s really quite and is easy to get to hard to reach spots
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,5/28/2020 20:20,bzm3j81,"Great battery system, great suction power.","I got the LG CordZero Stick Vacuum with Kompressor to help me keep my carpeted stairs clean. While we customarily take our shoes off at the door, I've got a cat that sheds like crazy and three kids that track stuff all over the house. I have a corded upright vacuum, but it's a bit of a chore to lug it around, plug it in, locate the right accessories, battle with the hose, then haul the vacuum up half the stairs and teeter the vacuum in one hand while swiping the accessory across the stair in another. Sometimes I could leave the vacuum at the top of the stairs, but I had to be careful not to pull too hard otherwise the vacuum would chase me down the stairs.

I really like the LG CordZero Stick Vacuum. Having two replaceable batteries eases my mind over a built in battery like a Dyson. According to the manufacturer, each battery is rated for about 60 minutes of run time without any power accessories. I got over 40 minutes of use on the lowest suction setting while using the Power Carpet Nozzle tool. Those 40 minutes were spread over several uses from my stairs and many carpeted rooms in my house. Note that the power accessories draw power directly from the battery to either spin the brush roll or vibrate the power punch panel.

Even at the lowest suction setting, it was pulling hair, dust and debris very easily and effectively from my plush carpets. I was very pleased with the noise level at this setting. It was fairly mild and much quieter than say a hair dryer. Switching to the next higher mode (Power Mode) is just a quick button tap away. Then the Turbo mode is activated by holding the same button for 3 seconds. 

After learning I could run for 40 minutes on the lowest setting, I ran the vacuum with a fully charged battery with the Power Carpet Nozzle accessory flat out in Power Mode and it ran for over 30 minutes. With another fully charged battery the Turbo mode only lasted about 7 and a half minutes. But it would be highly unusual for someone to run the vacuum this way. For one thing, you would need to stop to empty the canister every so often. For me, I turned off the vacuum while transitioning to other rooms. I vacuumed almost my whole house with one battery charge.

There are 3 indicator lights at the top of the handle to indicate battery charge. As the battery charge gets depleted, the first two lights will turn off. The third light will eventually flash to indicate a charge is needed. What surprised me is that the vacuum just shuts off when there is insufficient charge left. It doesn't chime, nor does it slow down as a final warning.

Another thing I noticed is that with the power accessory attached, it powers the accessory for a moment before supplying suction when the system is turned on.

The extension wand has a two way button to extend the wand an additional 6 inches with stops available every couple inches. It made a dramatic improvement in comfort. 

While the Power Carpet Nozzle glides over hard floors, it takes some effort and sometimes requires my second hand on the extension wand to move the Power Carpet Tool head across my very plush carpet. I think it is because the wheels are so small that they sink into my carpet before they can be effective.

The Kompressor feature is new for this model of Stick Vacuum. This feature allows you to squish down the accumulated dust, hair and other bits to pack more stuff into the canister between canister cleanings. This is accomplished by pressing down a spring loaded lever that controls a ring that sweeps down around the mesh filter. This is very handy as most of my canister contents is dust and hair that can be easily compacted.

The included stand is OK. It can hold and charge the second battery or charge the battery installed on the vacuum. It will always charge the vacuum mounted battery first and then charge the battery on the stand. The two non-power accessories (crevice and combination tools) can be stored on the stand. I was disappointed to learn there is no storage for the Power Carpet Nozzle nor the Power Punch Nozzle. I was also disappointed to learn that the non-power tools have to be stored in a specific place. Included in the package is a Cleaning Brush, after looking at things closer, the Cleaning brush can be only stored in the front tool storage, this necessitates that the Combination Tool to be stored in front since the Combination Tool can slide over the Cleaning Brush and that leaves the Crevice tool to be stored in the back. The tools are released from storage with the release button. But that also means that the tool needs to be rotated so that the release button is accessible by my fingers. While I could keep the vacuum base and extension wand assembled on the stand, I prefer not to have either of the Power Heads installed at the end of extension wand because it would require the heads to tilt and put some additional stress on the vacuum docking guides. Please note that even if you decide to leave the charging stand on the floor, LG does not want you to leave the extension wand and either of the Power heads installed as it causes too much weight and can damage the docking guides.

Is it too much to ask that a stand have tool storage for all the tools included with the vacuum?

I kinda chuckled that this Stick Vacuum has WiFi connectivity. My first smart LG device is a Washer. So I already had the LG ThinQ app on my phone. After following the directions to connect this Stick Vacuum to my phone. I could get push notifications of Charging Complete messages. The app is also good to keep a running tally of number of uses per month and accumulated time in each of the 3 power modes. I've noticed that the statistics don't come in until you power on with the next cycle. I also was sad to learn that I cannot drill down into the statistics. You are only given the accumulated values for the month. I couldn't, for instance, check to see how much time I spent in each of the 3 power modes on my fourth usage cycle or even for the current day. The app also seems to provides basic maintenance reminders similar to my washer.

In the end, I'm glad I got this LG CordZero Stick Vacuum. It is going to work well for me on the stairs, but it will also work great for my hard floors and quick sweeps on my carpet between deeper cleanings with my corded upright vacuum."

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,2,12/24/2021 19:18,CarefreeGamer,not worth the price,"After a few months of use, you can definitely see the wear and tear.  It just does not clean as good, even after washing and replacing the filters.  It clogs up very easily if you use it continuously & the maximum setting isn't very strong.  For the price, it's not worth it.  The Dyson might be a better buy."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/18/2020 21:24,Krisspe,Really good stick,much longer battery life and way more powerful than the Dyson I had
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,9/26/2020 9:21,Apollopro,Very quiet and convenient vacuum,"Strange thing about this is that the packaging for these vacuums are all very dirty and even dirty on the inside. may be in storage for too long. 
the vacuum it self is very nicely built, especially the details that keep noise down. it has padded sides so that even when you change directions or touch furniture, the sound it makes is very minimum."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,5/30/2020 16:11,gpitts,No-Compromise Cordless,"Just because a product is powered by batteries does not mean it will not perform. The LG CordZero Bagless Cordless Stick Vac with Kompressor Technology is proof of that. We got this primarily for our carpeted stairs, where dragging a power cord around is undesirable (and potentially dangerous). I should mention that we have three dogs in the house, so picking up pet fur was a must - and it did that very well.

Power was not an issue with this vacuum. Carpet pile stood up after use! A nice practical feature is a combination storage and charging stand. It has a boost mode for increased power/suction, but you would not want to use this continuously since the mode consumes a lot of power and therefore reduces the runtime obtained from a single battery. Speaking of batteries... this model comes with two, which makes larger vacuuming tasks easier to accomplish without running out of power.

Well-designed product by LG! I recommend it for anyone like us who have good solutions for upstairs and downstairs, but were struggling to find the perfect solution for stairs."

But for a vacuum that claims to do well with pet hair, it misses the mark.  There's a ring inside the canister that all debris is supposed to stay below and the ring is there to help push out the debris.  The issue is pet hair constantly gets stuck above the ring and then clogs the units.  Poor design and quite annoying.  Then the swivel at bottom broke which was the final straw and prompted a return.  Sorry, I should have grabbed photos before I returned it."

We have a pet that sheds a lot so had to use the turbo function most of the time to get the fur out of rugs and furniture. Hard floor surfaces we fine with the standard. The features of the vacuum are nice but not necessarily better or more useful than comparable models. As for the accessories- The stand was a nice addition as it makes charging somewhat portable. Also the 2nd battery is a nice addition. The battery life was the real advantage I could see. I was able to clean about twice the space as compared to other brands I have tried on the single battery charge. My wife seemed to think the ease on cleaning out the canister was the best feature. Over all this is a solid vacuum, are there better ones, yes however in this price range I don’t think you can do better."

I love all the features, the size, the weight, it's all perfect. However it states in the description it's suitable for 'multi surfaces' but let me tell you- it is way too challenging to push forward on carpet unless you have flat rug-like carpet. I have semi plush carpet and find it too hard to push to the point my shoulder was sore and I'm a sturdy size and 5'10. Not to mention for the price point this vacuum should work on all surfaces.

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,3,9/11/2020 20:21,claykin,"pretty good, but not great","This vac needs a better floor brush.  The universal floor brush is at best, average.  Decent on carpet, but it requires some effort to move while vacuuming carpet.  On hard floors it's OK, but nowhere near as good as a soft roller brush.

The ""kompressor"" feature is OK, but the handle to compress the dirt doesn't go all the way down to assist in removing dirt while trying to empty the bin.

Suction is good, but still a step behind the Dyson V11.

Overall an OK alternative to Dyson, but not as good."

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,5/28/2020 15:12,TcCokato,Works Well on Carpets; Struggles with Hard Floors,"LG CordZero™ A9 Kompressor Stick Vacuum works well in carpeted areas, unfortunately, the powerhead does not adapt well to hard floors so small debris tend to be pushed rather than picked up. Previous models had a dedicated hard floor powerhead, which would greatly improve the performance of this model. Despite the less than stellar performance hardwood, it works very well on carpeted areas. I especially like the grab and go convenience for spot cleaning without the hassle of dealing with cords. I also like the versatility of the attachments, the exceptionally long battery life, and portability!

One last note, even though this system is not “pet” rated, it had no trouble removing pet hair from carpets and furniture.

Pros
• Convenient
 - No cords to tangle
 - Easily gets under furniture
• Kompressor™
 - Quickly cleans dust cup
 - Improves suction
• Long battery life
 - 40-60 minutes with a single battery on normal setting and powerhead
 - Extra battery included for up to 120 minutes of use. 
• Suction
 - Normal mode is suitable for general light cleaning
 - High mode is necessary to clean heavily soiled areas.
 - Turbo mode works well for deep cleaning but drastically reduces battery life. 
• Washable Filters and cyclone channels to ensure suction is maintained. 
• Sturdy storage stand
 - Lacks storage locations for included power punch head
• Lightweight and comfortable
• Adjustable wand
Cons
• Works well on carpeting but struggles on hard floors
 - Powerhead does not adjust for flooring types, so it tends to push small debris instead of picking them up. This is especially noticeable on hard floors 
• Clogs easily
 - Small debris become trapped in the dust cup inlet
 - Debris tend to become trapped above Kompressor™ requiring manual removal."

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,6/4/2020 15:58,Alrobmoe,Cordless Wonder,"This is LG's entry into the high-end cordless vacuum market, and I love it. It's powerful, portable, and versatile. It can transform into whatever you need it to, from a powerful vacuum for carpet, a light vacuum for floors, or a handheld for vacuuming out your car. There are other high-end cordless vacuums out there (namely from that company that starts with a ""D"" and rhymes with Tyson), so I'll focus on what distinguishes this from those offerings.

Pros: 
- A charging stand that has storage for the attachments
- Very quite, I can vacuum while my kids are asleep
- A power button. Wait, what? It may sound silly, but other vacuums I've used have a trigger that you have to hold down, and it can strain your hand muscles as you move around to different angles. This vacuum has a button you just push once and it stays on. 
- A back up battery and filter. These are very nice to have. Sometimes others in the house forget to put the vacuum back on the charger (I still love you honey) so it's nice to have a spare to use when you need it. Also, I've had to wait for a filter to dry when I really needed to use the vacuum, so a second to use when you clean the filter is nice. 
- Battery life. I have about a 3,000 sq. ft. house with mostly hardwoods, so I don't have to use full power much. But it will vacuum the entire house thoroughly and still have half power left (about 30 minutes)
- Sleek, high tech look. It's a very futuristic looking vacuum. The status display that indicates the battery power and other icons is digital. 
- It has a slider that makes it easy to clean dirt and dust stuck to the filter in the dust bin. No more reaching into the dust bin to pull stuff out. 

Cons:
- While the stand has room for storing attachments, you can't fit the smaller brush attachment. Might as well design it to fit everything, and not just a couple accessories.
- The smaller brush head is ineffective. It has a yellow rubber brush that vibrates and doesn't spin. I find that it balls up pet hair making it easy to pick up, but it doesn't suck it up. So I have to take off the attachment to suck up the hair clump. I think a spinning brush is much better. 
- WiFi feature. I didn't get to try it out so I don't really know what it does. It's only compatible with 2.4 Ghz wifi networks. My mesh network is set at 5 Ghz, and I'm not going to switch it to 2.4 Ghz for my vacuum. I was so put off by this, I didn't pursue it further. I'm not sure why LG doesn't make their products compatible with a 5 Ghz signal. 
- The dust bin requires 2 steps to open and clean. You have to push a button to open the lid, and then push the slider down to clean it out. Minor issue, but seems like it would be easy to make the slider open the lid as well so you can clean out the dust bin in one step. 

All in all, a great vacuum that I highly recommend. The only real issue I have with it is the ineffectiveness of the smaller brush attachment. But the other features more than make up for it in my opinion."

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,5,6/5/2020 0:24,kayjay104,Excellent cordless vac,"Usually when you search for cordless vacs that actually clean you end up with 1 main player in the market place. This cordless stick vacuum from LG is a refreshing addition to the space. 

The weighted charging stand has a very compact footprint which can be easily placed in the corner of any room. The dock allows you to store the vacuum and it's attachment with ease. The dock also allows you to keep the spare battery charged so that you can have uninterrupted cleaning power. The vacuum itself also has very light and compact design which lends itself to easy cleaning everywhere.
The filters in the vacuum are also washable which is great so you don't see a loss in suction over time. One design flaw that I did notice during cleaning was that it is very easy to clog the inlet of the tank which would cause a loss in suction. They also do include a extra filter in the box

I used the vacuum to clean 2 carpeted staircases that are routinely cleaned with another stick vac and I was so surprised to see the amount of fine dirt this stick vac was able to extract from the carpet. I also found it very easy to vacuum the inside of my car with the attachments provided. The rated battery life of 120 minutes is only if you don't use a powered attachment. Using the powered attachments I was easily able to get 60 minutes of cleaning between the 2 batteries. 60 minutes is far superior than my previous premium stick vac and you can charge the depleted battery simply by charging it on the stand.

I would definitely recommend this cordless stick vac to anyone looking for a great cleaning solution for their home"

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,6/1/2020 18:41,TickledPink,High Quality,"Right out of the box, this vacuum just feels of good quality. This wasn’t a big surprise to me since it’s considered to be up there with the other high-end stick vacuums — and, in my opinion, LG makes decent products across the board. The ratings are out there. Do your research and you’ll see that the LG CordZero vacuum motors and design get the job done and are built to last (10 yr warranty). As far as cordless vacuums go, I’m not sure this can be beaten in the suction department.

In a nutshell, this vacuum is worth it’s premium price when you consider the quality build and, maybe most importantly, the fact that you get two extended-life batteries to increase your usage times for big jobs.

What I like; what I wish was different:

The batteries — This is a definite upgrade from previous models that also came with 2 batteries. Going from the previous 80 min. to 120 min. of run time (on low) is a big plus.

Larger dust bin — This is another positive upgrade, going from a 12.8 ounce capacity to 38.4 ounces means less trips to the wastebasket — especially when you couple this with the following design improvement…

Kompressor technology — This is a rather simple, but useful, addition to increasing your run time between dumping the bin. It’s a spring-loaded ring that slides down around the interior cylindrical filter, enabling you to compress hair and dust down into the lower part of the dust bin, thereby restoring suction power for awhile longer. It works as described.

Power settings — There are 3 settings. Keeping it simple, I’ll call them low, medium, and high (what LG calls ‘turbo’). Obviously, the higher the setting, the faster the batteries are used up. When you first power up the vacuum, it’s on low. After a few seconds of run time, you can press the + button a second time for medium. This is probably my favorite/most used setting on wood flooring. I just like knowing that I’m hopefully vacuuming up just a bit more than I would be on low. For me, the lowered overall run time due to increased battery usage is worth it. Others (maybe even you) may feel that the low setting is sufficient. You would just have to test it to see for yourself. To move into the high setting, you have to hold in the + button for about 3 seconds. Call me nit-picky, but this seems odd. Why can’t I just simply press it once to go to the next level? Think of all I could get done while waiting those precious 3 seconds! Just seems strange…but definitely not a deal-breaker.

Charging/Storage stand — Well built; heavy duty, and you can mount it to the wall if you so desire (hardware included). The base is weighted so it stays in place fairly well on its own. BUT — strangely, not all of the included vacuum heads will stow away. What the heck, LG! The tools store. The vacuum, vacuum tube and one head store. That leaves one of the two powered heads homeless. Oddly, the larger universal powered head even has an extrusion sticking out that was used to hang this on previous model’s stands — but this stand does not include that hanger. Very strange. Seems like an oversight on LG’s part.

Universal powered head — (What LG calls a ‘nozzle.’) Looking at previous stick vac systems offered by LG, some packages have included both a powered rolling brush head and a powered head with a foam type roller for hard floors. This latter style (with the foam roller, which I believe they used to call the “powered floor nozzle”) seems to have gone away. It’s sole purpose was for cleaning hard floor surfaces. Now, LG has renamed what they used to call the powered ‘carpet’ nozzle to be ‘universal.’ In other words, one powered head for all floor surfaces. Is this a good thing? I actually like the idea. You don’t have to stop and change heads when you’re going from wood to carpet, or vice versa. I can only imagine that the roller brush is a bit noisier than the foam roller would be, but I certainly don’t find it annoying.

Power punch head — This little head is unique. There are no rollers — just a bumpy rubberized surface that vibrates (or punches) the surface being cleaned. This really is perfect for smooth blankets or sheets or upholstery. It doesn’t try to suck the sheet up into the vacuum. Awesome! The smoother the surface, the better it’s going to loosen small particles of dirt, dust and critters to be sucked into oblivion. The only unfortunate thing for me was that I was hoping it would work at getting cat hair from our couch that has a ribbed, velour-like fabric. Nope. It ended up just kind of pushing the hair around. When I switched it out for the much wider universal head, the problem was solved. The rolling brush worked great — but I really wish it was the same size as the punch head. That would be much easier to navigate around upholstered furniture…and car interiors. That’s something that LG should make — a smaller powered universal head (maybe you can purchase it separately?) I would probably use that more than the ‘punch.’

I'm taking away one star because of my concerns regarding the storage stand. All in all, this is a very good vacuum and I dare say that it would stand up against anything else out there in the stick vac market. Well done, LG."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,2,9/18/2020 15:50,franks,"Good product design, poor suction",The LG design of this vacuum is really good and the power brush works well when being used. The issue lies when using any of the other tools that you would use to suck up pet hair or pretty much anything else. We have 3 dogs and 2 cats and the main purpose was to have an easily transportable vacuum to get in corners and underneath things or small spaces. There just isn't enough suction power passed to the tools. Ended up returning the product due to price vs usability for our needs.

bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,6/3/2020 19:02,PretzelGuy,Overall great vacuum but extremely overpriced.,"We've been meaning to replace our vacuum for sometime. We opted to go with the LG over the dyson. Assembly is extremely easy, the charging base is excellent. You're able to charge 2 batteries at once, great feature. The vacuum itself is really nice, I really like how simple it is to empty out the unit as well. It's heavier than I thought it would be, that's not a bad thing. It does a great job picking up off of carpet. Having 2 dogs and a cat, this thing is perfect for quick cleanings. I would think for the price it would also be able to spot clean carpet with soap and water, missed opportunity on LG's part. The best part of the vacuum though, my 5 year old loves and now has his first chore. I've given this vacuum 4 stars because at $700 I feel like I could be getting more for my money."

Suction is nothing compared to a dyson. I own both now. I bought it thinking it might be better but only good thing is the battery length. Which isn’t even near the advertised 60min per battery. More like 15 min each. Still the ability to switch out the battery is convenient. If dyson came with that option it would be better.

It is well designed for years of service.

The LG Cord Zero was easy to unpack and assemble including its charging and storage stand. Wi-Fi was easy to connect and designed to diagnose problems with the appliance using your smartphone and LG's ThinQ software application. The vac is also set up to easily clean or change the filters built into the appliance and comes with one extra filter. Additional filters can be purchased LG, Amazon and other retailers."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,4,6/11/2020 21:05,Harrison,"Overall, a great stick vacuum cleaner!","Pros:
- This vacuum is QUIET.
- The vacuum is effective. I tried the vacuum on smaller particles and larger objects and I did not have any issues. 
- One vacuum head to cover both hardwood and carpet is super nice. 
- The vacuum has a Turbo option which is useful for “hard to vacuum” messes.
- The vacuum includes an extra battery, and both can be on the charger at the same time which is convenient if you have a large space and don’t want to wait for it to charge.
- Living in an apartment, I really appreciated that both a stand and a wall mount are included.
- It comes with a furniture attachment which is useful. 

Cons:
- The vacuum head for carpet/hardwood is loud when using on hardwood. 
- I didn’t find the wifi features to be useful.
- I accidentally hit the canister release once, could have been my own error. 
- The stand isn’t tall enough to leave the extender and the pointed nozzle attachment on which is frustrating."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,3,9/4/2021 14:45,Maxbird,Pros - and Cons,"I have both the LG CordZero and the Dyson Animal V11. Both are good and each has their pros and cons. But when it comes to picking up debris the Dyson wins, hands down. I have parrots who like to throw their food so we use the vacuum many times a day. I find the LG spits out larger pieces (size of a small seed!) however I think that's because of the brush on the carpet attachment which comes with it. I'm ordering the soft floor attachment - so we'll see. 

What I like about the LG is its a bit lighter and easier to maneuver. Especially on stairs. The telescoping wand is nice too. Also like the stand so it can go all over the house and stay there.

Also, prefer emptying the Dyson dirt cup. Comes apart easier.

So for now, depending on the job, I'm lucky enough to have both vacuums."
bestbuy,LG A927KGMS,1,5/4/2021 18:45,99noledeb,"After 6-9 months, in the market for a new vac.","I wanted to love this vacuum. I hate it and only use it as a hand vac now. I needed to replace my Dyson hand vac and really needed a stick vac so I purchased this, mainly because you do not have to hold a power button down when cleaning. It worked fine for a few months. My only complaint was that it needed to be cleaned once a week. Now, I clean it more often, which is not efficient. Anyway, the reason why I hate it is that after 2 days after cleaning, I will use the vaccum and when I turn it off, a quarter of what I picked up, falls back onto the floor. Do not buy if you are cleaning up pet food or litter. Now, I use a broom and the hand vac to clean it up. When comparing hand vac to hand vac, the Dyson is much stronger. This is even in high power mode. The battery life is better than the Dyson though. I do not feel that I should have to clean a vacuum more than once a week for it to work properly."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,4,5/26/2022 13:07,Mukman,Nice Multi Use Vacuum,"Set up and instructions were easy to follow.

LG even supplies 2 quick access cards with all the assembly and maintenance items needed. Well formatted and written.

You also can download an app called LG ThinQ to your phone. This is a smart home app for all things LG.  It allows you to see the usage of the vacuum, charge status, run diagnostic and shop at LG store. (As of the writing of this review, I could not find the filter bags at the LG store)

As quick overview, below are my pros and cons.

Pros:
•	Good Suction levels
•	Rolls Nice – Head stays down
•	Good battery life when in default mode
•	NO CORD
•	Self-Cleaning
•	Light weight
•	Extra battery with onboard charging
•	Hidden tool storage
•	Easy extend/disconnect buttons
•	On/off Power button

Cons:
•	Only 9” wide brush
•	Filter bag cost
•	Mop head unit disappointing
•	Would like larger collection bag or canister (People with pets)
•	Will push around larger items like cereal/pretzels on hardwood floors

Overall, I really like this, LG CordZero. It does the job well for what is designed for. The Self-cleaning tower is probably the most impressive feature.

 
As mentioned above (in Cons) the only small tweaks I would prefer is to make the head a little larger to cover more area at a time. The small size does have the advantage of getting between items like chairs though.


 I would also like to see either larger holding bag in the self-cleaning unit, or a canister you could just dump out. 
We have two dogs that shed, so the cleaning bag located in the self-cleaning stand will fill up quickly. 
I have used this about 10 times and the bag is almost full.
This will result in an added expense, so I do wish this bag was larger, or less cost for replacements. I found the bags online at $19.99 for a pack of three. (Thee came with the unit). If you have no animals, this will not be a problem for you.


Experience with cleaning: 

The stick itself is easy to extend with the push of a button. Much easier than other units I have tested.
You can easily add the accessory pieces to reach into ceiling corners etc. I did use the brush accessory to clean our ceiling fan grills and found that I had to use the turbo mode to prevent the dust from just falling on my head. All other vacuuming, I have used the default mode and it seemed to clean well.


What my wife noticed early on is that this unit will clean the light bathroom rugs without sucking them into the head unit like others do. Best vacuum so far at this task.


My experience with cleaning hardwood floors is that if you have normal dirt, it cleaned fine. If you had a larger piece of dried food, such as broken pretzel or a piece of cereal, the head unit would just push it around. If you need to pick those items up, I found if I simply picked up the head and pulled backwards over the debris, it picked up fine. I did use the Power mode for more suction.


Carpet cleaning worked well in normal mode.


The power and function switches are located on the top. No need to hold the button down to clean like some other units. You can hit the plus button for more suction and minus for less. If you hold the plus button down for three seconds you get into turbo mode. This has incredible suction but will drain your battery quickly.

Battery Max run time as indicated on the supplied card:
Using nozzle:
Turbo Mode – 6  Minutes
Power Mode – 20 Minutes
Normal Mode – 40 Minutes

Using a tool:
Turbo Mode – 7  Minutes
Power Mode – 30 Minutes
Normal Mode – 60 Minutes


The self-cleaning tower unit has a clean look, stores all your tools, and does a great job emptying the canister. It stands 40” tall and need to plug into the wall outlet. It stores all accessories and holds and charges the spare battery and the vacuum.

Every time you store the vacuum, you need to retract the stick and place into the base. Automatically the unit will empty the canister. This is a little loud but only last about 30 seconds. You can press the start/stop button on the top of the tower to bypass this if you like.


The Kompressor slider is nice feature. It allows you to compact the dirt in the canister using a simple slider lever, allowing more use between having to empty. Also allows you to discharge dirt when manually emptying the canister. Other units I have tested lack this feature and forces you to use a tool or your fingers to get all the dirt out. Nice job LG.

Speaking of tools, LG does include a small brush to clean out the canister when doing maintenance.

Filters appear easy to maintain and do an awesome job filtering out the dust and allergen particles.



Mop Head feature:

We did not find this super useful. It does an okay job laying water down on the floor to maybe remove something items the vacuum could not, but if has no option to spot treat with a little extra water like some mop units. The head has three water dispensing settings, Off, Low & High.
You are instructed to only fill the reservoir with water. We may try spraying some floor cleaner down first to see if we get better results. 
You must go slow when cleaning as well. After we cleaned the kitchen floor, we then ran a swiffer over the area and found it picked up quite a bit of dirt. So not sure this mop head will be used much for us.

So, final thoughts. I would say for a house mostly with carpet or hard floors with standard debris, this is a nice unit. The self-empty feature is fantastic.

If you have mostly hardwood, with kids that drop cereal or such larger (Pea size of large) items on the floor that you would like to pick up with the vacuum, there might be better choices such as vacuums with front soft roller, or other method to pick up larger items.
If you have mostly carpet and want a universal vacuum that can do your daily tasks, has a tower that can not only store and charge the vacuum but can also self-empty and hold all the accessories PLUS another battery. Then you might consider this LG CordZero All in One Auto Empty.
If the auto empty is not a feature you need, LG does offer other options for less cost.

Warranty – 1 year parts and labor, but 10 year on the Inverter motor.

bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,3,5/23/2022 19:24,mdh4pennstate,Good not Great and Expensive Cordless Vacuum / Mop,"With my review of this LG - CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum with Auto Empty and Kompressor, I give it 3 out of 5 stars.  Upon opening the three boxes, I located the instruction manuals.  Be prepared to dedicate some time to learn how to operate this product because it is not a function of plug and play!  It does take some time to put together, time to learn how to use, and finally, how to maintain.  The entire product takes up some floor real estate, measuring 40"" high, 14"" deep, and 18"" wide with depth and width measurements made with the two doors in the open position.

As for using the vacuum, I cleaned my entire home using the Universal Nozzle, covering luxury vinyl tile and carpet for a total run time of 29-minutes in Normal Mode to a fully exhausted battery.  Luckily there are two batteries with this product with the second battery in the charging station.  I have attached two pictures showing the amount of debris before and after using the Kompressor Lever.  As you can see from the debris, I have two cats that shed a LOT.  I then connected the vacuum back into the charging station and selected the Empty Dust mode.  I have attached a picture showing empty canister along with a picture of the Dust Bag, being approximately 3/4 full.

As for using the Mop Nozzle, you can only fill the mop reservoir with plain tap water with no cleaning agents at all.  There is a supplied water funnel that fills the reservoir with 200ml of water.  The Mop Nozzle is not intended to clean spills and only having the use of only water in the reservoir, I questioned how can this effectively clean floors.  For a test, I cleaned half my kitchen floor and much to my dismay, it didn’t look clean.  Perhaps my floor was too dirty so I found myself spraying a fine mist of tile floor cleaner and then going over with the Mop Nozzle.  If you had to clean a large area, I believe you would have to manually wash the mop heads, to avoid just spreading dirt around.

So in review of the price of $999 versus performance, I find this product not a great buy, hence 3 out of 5 star rating.  Here are some of the shortcomings I find in the design and function.  The vacuum Universal Nozzle does not have a lighted head making for cleaning in dark area or under beds cumbersome.  The size of the Dust Bag leads me to question its longevity before replacement as having mine ¾ filled with one use.  There isn’t a hard floor attachment for the vacuum and would not use the supplied beater-brush heads to clean delicate laminate flooring.  As for the Mop Nozzle, I find this for general light cleaning only along with the inability to use only water in the reservoir.  Finally as for attachments, there is the mention of some very useful attachments that such as Slim Hard Floor Nozzle, Flexible Hose Extension and its Crevice Tool, and Mattress Tool, as part of their Total Care Kit but they are free only if purchased directly through LG.com.  I hope you enjoyed my review of this product and it helps you in your purchase decision."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,5/30/2022 23:29,underdog217,This certainly doesn’t suck,"This vacuum is amazing with a lot of great features. When you first open the box, the vacuum and attachments are in three boxes. The initial set-up of the vacuum is fairly easy once you open everything. The base for the vacuum is very simple and modern. The vacuum sits nicely in the middle with auto charging, the sides are actually doors where you can store the attachments, the bag is on the inside of the base, and the extra battery charges on top. I love that I can store everything and not have to see it all. The package comes with the vacuum itself, the base, two batteries, a general vacuum attachment, pet hair attachment, mopping attachment, two smaller attachments, a spare battery, 4 microfiber mop clothes, two reusable filters, and two bags.

In my apartment, I have rugs and laminate floors. I had no issues with using the general vacuum attachment to clean everything. The suction is great, but you are able to increase the suction to turbo. The turbo works great for hair or extra dirt, but it does drain the battery quite a bit more. I recently had a friend with a dog visit and was excited to test out the pet hair attachment. It’s significantly smaller so if you have a large space, it may take longer to clean. I think it did a great job getting all of the hair out of my rugs. If you have a pet that is a heavy shedder, this may not be for you but mild-moderate shedding would be fine. They have a soft attachment that I used for corners, baseboards, window sills and it was perfect for cleaning up some dust.  

I was very excited about the mopping attachment. I think it’s a wonderful feature with some limitations. Directions say to only use water, so you can’t use any floor cleaner. You are suppose to wet the pads before starting, which is definitely necessary! The mop attachment has a water reservoir and three levels to dispense water: no water, low water, or high water. It certainly dispenses a lot less than I expected. I’ve kept it on high water and by the time I clean my kitchen floors, I couldn’t even tell the water tank was empty. I think this is a great feature for just regular maintenance of floors, but if you need to really clean them, may need to use a regular mop. The microfiber clothes are soft on the floor and the vacuum does a great job rotating them while cleaning. Safe to use on my laminate floor.

LG has produced a package of additional attachments to use with this vacuum, including a mattress attachment. I use the pet hair attachment on my mattress recently and worked fine! But it’s nice to know there are extra attachments to purchase. 

The biggest highlight of the system is the automatic dispensing. There’s nothing I hate more than emptying a vacuum and getting dust and hair everywhere. Once you bring the vacuum back to the base, it automatically charges and automatically cleans out the debris in the vacuum and dumps it into the bag. The system alerts you when the bag is ready to be changed. It does such a wonderful job at getting everything out of the vacuum! It is a bit loud when it does this, but it doesn’t take long. 

Overall, I highly recommend this vacuum! It’s sleek, lightweight, easy to use, and keeps everything clean. There’s always limitations to cordless vacuums, but overall this vacuum does an excellent job. I’m very satisfied and looking forward to cleaning with it!!"
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,5/17/2022 19:13,RalphHenry,Powerful Vacuum That Empties Itself,"I was very impressed with the functionality of this vacuum system. There are two parts, the cordless stick vacuum and the power base. The vacuum proved to be very powerful in cleaning about 1200 square feet of carpet on the turbo setting and still had plenty of charge left. This system came with two batteries. It is important to state one battery charges in the base power unit (to be ready when needed) and the other battery will also charge when the stick vacuum is docked on the base unit. Very smart design point. These 26 volt batteries provide a lot more suction power than the usual 14 to 18 volt systems; and proved long lasting as well.
After vacuuming 1200 square feet I noticed that the dust bin on the stick vacuum had about 3 inches of hair and dust particles. I had just used another cordless stick vacuum the day before for the same area. So this test definitely showed the LG vacuum power was far superior. 
The power base unit has its own vacuum setup to suck out the stick vac’s dustbin into a dust bag housed in the power base unit. I can confirm that the 3 inches of pet hair and dust was removed into the base unit (see my before and after photos). When I looked at the stick vac’s dust bin, not only was all the debris gone but it appeared the inside of the dust bin had been wiped clean – great system and a tip of the cap to the LG engineering team. You will notice that when the base unit cleans the stick vacuum dust bin, it actually opens the bottom plate on the dustbin and closes it again when the cycle is completed – I love that kind of engineering. The whole system has solid quality and is very well designed.
The system included a very complete set of accessories that included a small cleaning brush which was very handy for cleaning filters, a crevice tool, a combo brush and suction head that was great for cleaning car floors, a vacuum head with moving roller-brush for carpet, a mop head (2 spinning disc-shaped mops with liquid chamber) and a pet nozzle for furniture and other areas. Wow, a lot of uses covered. All these accessories store in the power base unit.
If all these features aren’t enough, the unit connects to your home’s WiFi system. Now using your cell-phone you can monitor activity of this vacuum system. I initially thought the WiFi control button was on the base unit, but it is on the stick vacuum and is labelled. The unit easily connected to the WiFi – you must use a 2.4 GHz access point.
I did also run the included mop head to clean my kitchen and bathroom floors. Easy job but be sure to wash the mop heads by hand after each use. It’s easier to dry the mop heads in a dryer but don’t put the heads in a washing machine.
The technology used in this vacuum system is outstanding. I highly recommend this vacuum system."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,5/19/2022 17:04,Zaid,"All-In-One Vacuum, storage, charge, and mop","During the last decade and companies are working on designing vacuums that are lightweight, cordless, easy to navigate, and emptying canisters. Usually, we have several options out there in the market to choose from but none of them truly offers what I exactly need. besides to aforementioned specs, self-emptying is becoming a demand. Personally, I would prefer to buy vacuums with such a feature only because of time constraints that lead me to invest in robot vacuums even though they are not as powerful as the regular human-operated ones. I believe and after my experience with this LG CordZero, I found that this LG provides me with a lot of conveniences; it is an all-in-one vacuuming solution, lightweight, and truly cordless since the tower serves as a storage, charger, and self-emptying whenever the vacuum is docked. it has powerful suction and looks modern and stylish. 

The LG tower has two doors that serve as storage areas to store different attachments in each door compartment. In addition, The tower top is accessible it has a lid that can open up, and inside that small compartment, there is a charging station as well as a storage area for the second battery located underneath the top lid of the tower. This means there is always a spare charged battery that is always ready to use if needed. This top lid is a touch display where all touch control buttons are located such as auto mode, battery life, and dust emptying. Auto mode activates the self-emptying every time the vacuum sits back on the tower. By turning off the auto mode, self-emptying can be activated manually. The middle area when both doors are open is the house of the dust bag. I like the vacuum telescopic wand, it is adjustable and sturdy and easy to use and maneuver to reach low and high places but it does not have headlights which is a drawback to me. 

The power mop feature is my other drawback, according to the manual it is not allowed to use any cleaning solution except water also the pads can be hand-washed only. From my experience, such limitation tells me that the power mop feature is marginal and not meant to be a replacement for the regular powered mop. It is still a nice touch to have for quick mopping but it is that efficient. The bin kompressor is a smart feature that doubles the storage of the tank which is a nice perk and I like it. It has a sliding handle that pushes and compacts debris to have more room for a longer vacuuming run. But what stands out about this stick vacuum is the self-emptying feature, it is convenient and provides a month of peace of mind and hassle-free bin emptying as well as the spare charged battery, and of course, the tower design in which all the attachments are stored, organized, and accessible.   

What is included in this all-in-one vacuum: Stick vacuum, power brush nozzle, telescopic wand, power mini brush, Power mop nozzle, Base plate with 4 self-adhesive pads, 4 washable mop pads, 3 dust bags, 2 batteries, and water cup, cleaning brush, and a combination and crevice tool."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,3,5/19/2022 15:04,bamfsig45,"Light weight, easy to use. Not the best suction.","The box this comes in is large, everything is packed nice and neat. Setup is pretty straight forward. But reading the guide might help some people.  The included attachments are the Power Mop for your kitchen or bathroom and hard surfaces. The crevice tool, a 2n1 combination tool, the telescopic wand and the Universal Power Nozzle, and two replacement vacuum bags for the base. All the attachments have a storage spot inside the two doors that open on either side of the main base station. Together this has everything you would need for keeping things clean.

Also has two rechargeable batteries with the following usage times.  Normal: 120min, Power: 60min, Turbo: 14min. Normal: 80min, Power: 40min, Turbo: 12min.  The batteries charge in the base/charging tower which is highly convenient.  One stays on the stick vacuum to charge and the other goes into the top compartment for charging.  

Onto the real world usage that I've done.  First I did not download the LG ThinQ app that is supposed to tell you things like cleaning patterns and errors ect.  Second the batteries come drained which will require charging before use.  I let them charge overnight.  Also, I have not used the power mop yet as of this review.  But plan too soon.  Its a vacuum first IMO.

I have a German Shepherd and if you know the breed, well they shed like crazy. So a good vacuum with lots of power is a necessity.  When first turning the stick vacuum on its in Normal mode. I could tell immediately that it wasn't going to be powerful enough for the job ahead. I quickly placed the vacuum on Turbo mode and it worked a lot better.  Still not perfect, but better than the default normal setting.  After 5 minutes of vacuuming I got a clog, the vacuum errored out and turned off.  I had to remove the attachments and pull out the hair from the top of the wand where it connects to the main unit, next to the canister. It appeared as though there was something large blocking the airway. Nope just dog hair.  After clearing the clog I went back to vacuuming and never had a clogging issue again (two days straight now).  Even the auto empty feature of the base would not unclogged the vacuum, just so you know.  But, as long as everything is in the canister then the auto emptying feature works very well.  You have to get the stick vacuum just right in the base for the Auto empty feature to work. Took me a couple times to get it right.

I did use this vacuum without the Power Nozzle for some spot cleaning and that worked ok.  It was just more dog hair along the edges of the rooms and the corners. Nothing big like spilt cereal or other food items. I feel it might struggle.

I feel the price for what you get, is a little high.  It just doesn't seem to have the power of my full size vacuum. And maybe it wasn't meant to replace that. But for the price you would think it would.  I will continue to use it full time though before I make up my mind fully.  Maybe if I didn't have a dog that sheds so much this would be a better fit.

I think for apartment dwellers and people without dogs (or at least shedding dogs) this would be a better fit.  Its hard to recommend this vacuum.  Another last minute note.  The vacuum bags are 19.00 a piece and according to the LG website the bags will hold 3 Kompressed loads of dirt before needing replaced. That's going to get expensive if you ask me.  I bet I find myself emptying the bags and re-using them. If that's even a possibility."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,5/19/2022 19:38,aved0n,Extraordinary and Beautiful,"If i could rate the LG CordZero™ All in One Auto Empty Cordless Stick Vacuum with higher than 5 stars i would do so, gladly.

First lets go over 2 terms that make this vacuum as incredible as it is.

KOMPRESSOR technology means that the dirt and dust is compressed in the waste receptacle thus meaning you have to dump less while vacuuming.

INVERTER technology means that the motor (which boasts a 10 year warranty by LG) operates at less than high speed without sacrificing suction power.

Impressed yet? Stick around it only gets better. A lot of products boast rhat they are a complete system leaving out that for their system to be complete ya have to shell out some more cash.

Not LG!!! Unboxing the LG CordZero™ All in One Auto Empty Cordless Stick Vacuum i found out quickly that this is an All in One system and came with everything needed to handle your vacuuming duties. Unboxing i said to myself, ahh ok but i'll bet it doesnt include XY or Z. It did, right down to extra waste bags.

The hard surface polisher / cleaner was most impressive with its stainless steel cleaning heads to the high quality housing. This isnt some entry level item but a real deal built to last tool.

Speaking of accessories the LG CordZero™ All in One Auto Empty Cordless Stick Vacuum comes with all the usual suspects (attachments), of course all high quality.

Now for the best part. We have all bought vacuumes that have a plethora of attachments that ya have to wonder, where the heck ro i store all of this. Honestly as in my case with the exception of 1 or 2 i wind up misplacing them.

This is why this is unique LG has built in storage foe eveything so it all stays in the base unit and is hidden from view. So Cool!!!

The LG CordZero™ All in One Auto Empty Cordless Stick Vacuum is light as a feather but a powerhouse for cleaning. It jandles pet hair and allergens with ease and with Kompressor tech the dirt is compressed for less stop and go time.

This baby comes with a second battery to give approximately just under 2 hours of cleaning time. Your time may vary. The wand extends so even a 12 year old can vacuum. Ha! Good luck with that though.

The base is a charger for both batteries, holder for accessories and auto recepticle for your debris. This elimintes the spillage of manually dumping the dirt.  Lets be honest, this thing is powerful and attractive. The app tells ya when its time to change bags and can order for you, if you like.

I cant say enough about this unit and I am sure you will agree too.


Cheers!"
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,2,5/27/2022 21:09,Magneto,Could be better on carpets,"This is a very expensive product and I cannot give it more than two stars. The base had a crack in it when the product arrived and it is something that I did not expect from a 1000 dollar product. Extra headache consumes time and I hope this was just a one--off incident.

It took me around 20 minutes to get the parts out of the boxes, read the directions (two separate booklets: one for the vacuum and one for the charging station. It took me around 30 seconds to put everything together. Unfortunately, the base of the charging station came broken in the box. The charging station has a smart bento box-like design where the parts can be inserted when not in use. There are three different insets for dry vacuum (regular), mopping, and narrower head to reach into corners. The last one is great for staircases, between car seats, and floor corners. The set up looks nifty and cute The battery charger works fast, battery life is good, self-cleaning mechanism of the dust works fine.

While the good looking, moderately heavy, good picker-up-er works well for lighter cleaning on hardwood floor, it could not handle my pet’s fur on carpet. The machine got stuck every few minutes and I had to open the top nozzle and clean out the rod with disposable chop sticks. My kids love crafting and carpeted floor in their room is always full of bits of paper. The bits of paper and the dog fur worked together and chocked the pipe after every two minutes. I will probably use this on hardwood floors, the car, and stairs only.

The function of the wi-fi is unclear to me and I am not sure if I will ever need to use the wifi. The placement of the turbo and wi-fi switches are a problem. It should probably be above the on/off switch instead of below. Or may be on the sides. While vacuuming, my hand kept hitting the turbo and that was a little annoying. Because of its top-heavy design, the vacuum cannot be kept anywhere in upright position except for the charging station. If you lean it on the wall, it will slide down because of the heaviness of the motor. 

This small expensive fancy thing is good for light clean ups but unsuitable for carpeted floors in with furries and messy kids, which is a big disappointment at this price-point."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,5/26/2022 10:32,2leo2,"Sweet, Light, Quiet, and Smooth","The LG vacuum is great, lightweight and cleans not only hard floor and carpet, but also itself. The battery lasts about 1.5 hours, which should be enough to clean the It comes with a second battery that can be charged while the primary battery is being used. The charging dock however has a place to store and charge both batteries at the same time if needed.  All accessories have storage space in the base, so you don't have to find a place for them. Has awesome wifi features to detect cleaning efficiency.

The mop attachment is not better than a steam mop but it does the job. The motor is quiet and mobility is smooth and effortless when pushing along the floor. I love the self cleaning feature, saves me time from cleaning out the vacuum myself. It does get loud during this process but it only lasts around 20 seconds. I had to clean out the canister that the waste goes in every 4 full uses, which isn't that often. Assembly is easy, just came in 5 pieces.

Overall, the vacuum is a well needed product and  conveniently packaged in a way to prevent major maintenance."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,5/25/2022 9:43,Idoc,Compact rechargeable self emptying vacuum,"I found the LG CordZero All in One to be quite capable.  It cleans hardwood and tile easily.  Using the mop head to clean was a breeze on our hardwood and kitchen flooring. The battery life was good using only 1 bar after vacuuming the whole house.  I like how lightweight it is and makes cleaning the stairs fast and easy.  It struggles just a bit on low pile rugs, but was able to do the job. A pile adjustment would be a welcome addition. The turbo switch offers more suction when needed. The ability to use the vaccine without the stick extention is great for upholstry and automotive vacuuming. 
As for looks the charging stand will be at home in any modern decor. The stand itself is clean looking and compact. The vacuum automatically empties it's contents and charges when it is docked. The stand hold the vacuum with the stick extension and vacuum head without disassembly. The accessories are stored neatly on the right side hidden from sight under the side door. The left side opens for filter and vacuum bag replacement."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,5/23/2022 14:15,Josh76,The vacuum that does it all,"I gotta admit, I'm a sucker for a great vacuum.  I have 3 cats, 2 rooms with carpet and lots of furniture so a great vacuum is a must for me.  I need to be great at 3 things: picking up cat hair from carpet and furniture, it needs to be great on hardwood for various cleanups, it must be light and convenient to use, and of course, it needs to be cordless. This new LG checks all of those boxes plus it has a mop! 

Do not be scared off by the giant, heavy box that this comes in.  The tower that holds everything is incredibly easy to set up and the instructions are very detailed.  I had this up and running within 15 minutes.  I love how the tower holds all of the attachments plus an extra battery so I will never run out of juice.

The vacuum is light, powerful and does everything I need.  It picks up cat hair and litter with ease and does a great job on my carpeted floors.  The battery life is fantastic and the turbo modes give me the extra power when I need.

The tower works to empty the vacuum automatically so there is nothing stopping me from cleaning.  The mop feature is pretty cool too.  I have very shiny floors and it is tough to get them looking good, but this did the job well for quick cleanups.

I could not be happier with this system and look forward to many years of use."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,5/18/2022 12:03,Maclemoor,Awesome vacuum tower,"The LG cordless zero A9 k is a beast of a machine. There are so many functions of this vacuum also mop that it’s hard to take it all in. The mop pads are super easy to connect disconnect take off and clean. Adding water to the tank is easy as well. It’s not a big water tank so using all of the water and cleaning out the tank makes for a cleaner reuse. Make sure you dry the water tank. The Wi-Fi is easy to connect if you have the app. I don’t use it because I don’t need it. But it is a good option. I put together the entire tower in less than 10 minutes. I like that it comes with two batteries. Straight out of the box I was able to vacuum part of my house. Charging takes overnight but  it also depends on what mode you use. Regular mode isn’t enough to pick up all of the dog hair. Power mode is a good option and last between 20 and 30 minutes.
Turbo mode only last seven minutes but it does pick up larger items. The fact that you have a second battery is also very helpful. The nozzles are able to be used on furniture and I can take it outside and use it in my car. The sound is fairly loud when you hook up the vacuum to the tower for the automatic empty. Not a big issue. I really like the compressor system because I’m able to vacuum a lot more without emptying more often. Overall this is a great vacuum I am unsure about the filter bags since we have a puppy we will go through a lot of them."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,3,5/24/2022 19:52,doop22,It's good but there are better options out there,"I received the LG CordZero Stick Vacuum with high expectations, and after using it for about a week, I was meh about it. 

It comes loaded to the 9s with attachments and spare parts, like washable and reusable filters, a spare battery. What I was not expecting was a mop attachment to clean up small spills.

Set up was simple, just find the parts and build the vacuum like a very expensive Lego set. The canister stand is pretty straight forward, just plug it in to the outlet. It does open up like an armoire revealing compartments for the attachments, you're most likely to use often. The top of the stand flips up, revealing a spot to charge the spare battery. Even the waste bin and filter were already installed and ready to go. With the auto empty feature or it being turned on at all, does lock the vacuum in to the dock so it can't be removed while emptying. It even plays a little song while doing so. 

There is an app that I was told to use while reviewing the CordZero, but it was absolutely useless as it doesn't do much for the function of the vacuum. The most I believe you would use it for would be to reorder replacement filters or something. I wasn't able to register it for warranty as I didn't actually purchase this unit, so there's that unless I didn't something wrong on my end.

In use it's an extremely capable vacuum, it cleans really deep in turbo mode, pretty lightweight and emptying it is super convenient with the Auto Empty feature but can be emptied as any other $90 canister stick vacuum would be able to by just dumping the canister into the trash."

bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,1,11/4/2022 11:13,AnnR,I wanted to love it and I rarely return but…sigh,"I really wanted to love this machine.  My vacuum died and company was coming.  I love LG products so when the salesman suggested it we went for it, without reading the reviews. Got it home, put it together and after vacuuming about 20 sq feet of an oriental rug it started to whir three times and died…plugged.   Put it on the stand to clear and that didn’t work.  You have to pull out the metal part in the middle of the canister and maneuver your hand to try and clear the too small pipe that feeds the canister.  This machine constantly clogs on anything from pet fur to tiny cellophane candy wrappers.  If you are lucky you can finish vacuuming an 8 x 10 rug if you manually empty it three times.   I’m allergic to dust so a self cleaning vacuum would have been sooo nice but I was constantly manually emptying it.  The other features are great.  It’s light and easy to maneuver.  Suction was good.  It’s quiet and was the first vacuum that didn’t scare my dog. The accessories were plentiful.  It had style and was ok in my dining room. Darn you LG.  I honestly tried. In fact I’m lucky I’m a total tach member and get more than 15 days to return. I bought another that is for pets and it’s doing a great job.  In fact the first time I used it I knew immediately that the LG suction was inferior based on what it was picking up on just the Oriental rug. I’m really not sure how this product got into production.  Great idea, poorly executed."

This LG creation breaks away from the land of stick vacuum clones by offering a system not found anywhere else. An all-in-one, self-contained self-emptying charging station hides the messy side of vacuuming. This cleaning system competes in the elite top tier of vacuums against the granddaddy cyclone vacuum and other primetime names in cordless stick vacuums space. The beautifully designed stand/tower creates a place for everything, so attachments are neatly placed and visible in a stand that automatically charges and cleans the vacuum. Hence, it is ready when you need it to be. No more looking for attachments or where you left the spare battery. It is all in one tower for you. There is just a simple and well-thought-out execution missing from other brands.
 
Unboxing and Setup
Everything was well packed and secure - straightforward and intuitive to set up. Remove everything from the box, and you will see how everything fits together once you put the stand on the floor. I want to mention that it was a pretty heavy box at around 50lbs - for some, this may be a team lift, so plan accordingly. Once you place your stand, but all the accessories inside the tower and admire your work. Everything looks so lovely in that corner now, doesn't it!?!? This has smart connectivity, but I chose not to use it after it only supports 2.4GHz networks… REALLY? We are in 2022, and we still only support 2.4GHZ WiFi?
 
Performance and Differentiators
The most wonderful feature here on this vacuum is the simple use of an on/off switch. No more holding a trigger - press once, and you are good to go until you are finished. The inclusion of the electric mop is nice and offers added value and cleaning power for your arsenal. LG is changing the game here rather than copying the granddaddy of vacuums. The telescoping wand allows reconfiguration to compensate for differences in cleaning areas and user heights. The spare battery lives in a charging station just under the lid that you can quickly remove if necessary. The electric mop offers a floor scrubbing solution but isn't complete because it can't vacuum up like a dedicated electric mop to leave your floor streak-free. This is meant to be an agitator and doesn't suck up dirty water from the floor. Think a Swiffer with motorized scrubbers and then an air-dry with what's left on the surface.
 
Build Quality and Battery Life
The LG CordlessZero has just an okay build, almost entirely plastic build with beautiful minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing stand that will blend into any decor. I worry for those who drop their vacuum a lot of bang into things with all the plastic here. The attachments are all plastic, with the electric mop having metal. Now let's talk battery life here. I tested on the carpet with carpet head. I got about 35 mins on MEDIUM (+) power (probably could go a bit longer, but I finished. When set on TURBO and you get maybe 10 mins, and on NORMAL you get around an hour. I have never run out of battery yet during a cleaning session taking care of 3 levels with stairs and carpets in my 2500 sq ft place. Here are the specs straight from LG's website pertaining to the battery life for Normal (handy): 120min, Power (handy): 60min, Turbo (handy): 14min. With floor wand Normal (Stick): 80min, Power (Stick): 40min, Turbo (Stick): 12min.
 
Here is a quick list of my things that make this vacuum excellent and some things I wish were thought through again. Hopefully, these things can be addressed in future renditions.  
 
Love
-On/Off switch - no more trigger pulling for long sessions.
-Portable power - it's great for auto cleaning and quick cleanups. I take it to the office to touch up the desk and take it home.
-Lightweight in the hand - you can clean for a while as fatigue is reduced due to design and weight.
-Kompressor button - being able to touch the stuff in the canister without touching it is nice.
-Tower Stand - completely self-contained in a minimalist stand. No need to wall mount a charger.
-2 Batteries - two batteries provided with one stored and charged so it is always ready for a swap.
-Quieter - it is quiet, but the performance suffers as well. Run this on medium for better cleaning, and it still is quiet compared to other vacuums I tried.
-3 step HEPA filtration - clean, breathable air for those with allergies and who don't like to empty the bin.
 
C'mon Man!
-2.4GHz WiFi Networks ONLY! - only supports 2.4GHz networks… REALLY? We are in 2022, and we only support 2.4GHZ WiFi?
-Power button placement - Often, you can press it by just walking around with it or placing it on the dock.
-Maintenance - with all the features, there is maintenance. You need to maintain filters in the tower, the self-emptying part, and the hand unit.
-Deep cleaning performance - things sometimes don't get sucked up in one pass with minimal improvement in TURBO mode. Larger cereal isn't easily vacuumed.
-TURBO mode activation - it takes FOREVER to activate. It feels longer than 3 seconds but sheesh!
-No AUTO suction mode - highly disappointing to a vacuum in this range
-No on-wand clip for attachments
-Battery indicator - no timer useful with remaining battery life. Old style 3 bar battery for you to guess from. Minutes left would be more valuable as the rest of the pack provides these days.
-Tiny Dust bin capacity - 300ml, which is 40% smaller than competitors
-Non-removable bin - You cannot separate the container from the handle to clean like competitors
-Exhaust position - while using, you will get exhaust in your face. Use this on your stairs or anywhere you have the vacuum below your face and enjoy a blast of hot air. I slightly angle the handle, and it helps a little.
-Plasticky build - everything from the tube to the vacuum itself and its accessories are plastic! I hope you aren't rough and bang into furniture or walls. After a few drops with the wand attached, I don't see this lasting.  
-Battery life - isn't that great compared to others in the market, but you get two, so it is not as bad.  
-Roller drags - compared to other vacuums used on carpet, the head has a significant drag and pressure when going through medium shag rugs. It often ""digs"" into the carpet, and you have to push to regain control.
-Loud in Turbo mode - like REALLY loud!"
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,3,5/25/2022 14:38,Jack,Expensive feature-rich with mediocre performance,"The LG Cordzero “all-in-one” system is an interesting (and expensive) idea that tries to accomplish all things you’d expect from vacuum cleaners. The package includes most of the items I’d usually need for everyday use, and the impressive base station, though being quite large and hefty, is feature rich. The attachments are good, and so is the ergonomics. It is a truly multifunctional tool.
The stick vacuum itself is well designed and well-balanced. The motor, near the top end, is very compact for its power and the telescopic handle makes it very easy to use. After using it to vacuum carpets and some tile floors I didn’t feel much fatigue compared to my other stick vacuums. The roller head (Universal Nozzle) can move around to reach a lot of hard to reach places. However, with “normal” operation I felt the suction power is not that great - with my “moderately clean” carpets with the usual dog hair etc. I frequently switched to the “Power” mode (and a few times to the “Turbo” mode). This drastically reduced the battery life and had to swap out the provided 2nd battery almost all the time. Without the 2nd battery and the charging station, this would have been a no-go from the very start. Of course, this depends on what type of carpets you have and how dirty they regularly get, but for me I’d appreciate it a bit more under Normal mode. But this is a drawback for almost all cordless vacuums I have used so far. The highly-touted Kompressor technology is just a manual lever that pushes down the debris inside dust bin. This helps pack more dust before I need emptying, but more me looked like an over-hyped idea. One thing to point out that the package does not include the slim hard-floor nozzle, so maybe that would be a better head to use for non-carpeted areas. However I did not have the means to try that out.
As for the Mop Nozzle - I have to say I’m quite disappointed with it. Only water can be used as the cleaning fluid, and the speed is fixed. This made it almost ineffective if there’s a speck of dirt in my tiled floor. For my use case, it was an ultra-low-duty attachment, and would only be useful if I could use it every single day. It is very very limited in its use, so if you plan to use it be wary.
The other “powered” head is the Pet Nozzle, which lists a lot of limitations in the manual (it can’t be used with clothing, bedding, leather sofas, cushions, carpet, vinyl flooring, tiles, marble) which made me wary to use it all. There are also crevice tools and a combination tool (crevice and brush) included as well which are very handy. Using these heads without the telescopic handle effectively transforms this into a handheld vacuum that I used to clean my car interior.
The charging/base station, as I mentioned earlier, is quite big and heavy. LF provides a plastic base with rubber feet to keep it standing, and mounting kit is there to tether it to a wall if needed. I did not have an issue with it as long it was not in a high-traffic area. The station, along with housing the stick vacuum, can charge the included extra battery, and has nifty ways to organize the tools/heads. The star feature is the Auto-empty functionality that automatically cleans out the dust bin from the vacuum body and puts it into a removable dust bag. I found the feature to be very useful (especially when I’m feeling lazy and wanted to create as little mess as possible) albeit noisy. By default the station performs this auto empty procedure every time the vacuum is docked, but this can be changed easily. The only drawback I saw was that the dust bag fills up quite easily and I’ll run out of those (only 3 are included) soon.
In terms of ease of use and smart features: I consider myself a tech-savvy person and am always looking forward to trying out new techs. But this vacuum left me baffled a number of times. For the first few days, I had to get the user manual to figure out what needs to be done. That’s the price you pay for getting a “feature” rich machine, but in my opinion this may leave people a bit frustrated. The LG ThingQ app does not add a lot of functionality - it can store cleaning history and can perform “Smart diagnosis”. But since I haven’t faced any functional issues with it I can’t comment how well it can actually solve problems.
Overall, I like the LG Cordzero All-in-one system for trying to be an all-in-one solution. But I wish, for the price, I was getting a bit more performance. If you have a light-duty need this will be a very good solution, but given the price you have to really think about the pros and cons. This could have been great with the large feature-set, but its mediocre performance made it more gimmicky for my needs."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,5/24/2022 15:58,CDF3,Nice vacuum with a lot of features,"The LG CordZero is a nice vacuum cleaner with quite a few features. Taking the vacuum out of the box was fairly easy and straight forward. Setting up the unit is fairly easy, but I’d highly suggest reading the manual. There are a lot of things I would have missed if I had not read the manual. The charging base station is pretty much already assembled out of the box. The only labor involved for the base station is placing the gaskets on the bottom of the base plate, and setting the charing base station onto the base plate. The vacuum does a fairly decent job on the different floors I used it on. It did OK on carpet, but I felt it could use a bit more power. This was even after I cracked it up to Power Mode and then to Turbo Mode.  I was able to use it to clean dirt and debris from my hardwood floors. I was a bit nervous using it on my hardwood floors because I only have the Universal Floor Nozzle. I had some debris that got caught underneath the nozzle and slightly scratched an area of my hardwood floors. Perhaps I may look into getting the Slim Hard Floor Nozzle that didn’t come with the unit I have. After I vacuumed the hardwood floors, I then used the mop pads to clean them. The water reservoir isn’t as large as a floor cleaner I own by a different manufacturer. I assumed I would have to fill it up a few times while mopping the floors. I was wrong, and it was enough to clean all of the hardwood floors and tile floors. It did a good job of disbursing the right amount of water. There’s a button to adjust the amount of water you want disbursed while mopping the floors. The mop pads turn in a circular direction, which you cannot adjust the speed at which they spin. The mop nozzle also comes with LED lights on the front that illuminate onto the floor while in use. The charging base station has a nice feature of automatically emptying the debris from the vacuum into a dust bag. Once the bag becomes full overtime, it will have to be disgarded. There’s no way to empty the bags and reuse them because they have a plastic slide rail attached to the top of each bag. I wish the bags were reusable or if they could have used a plastic bin that can be emptied. Over time the price of buying new bags might be costly. I empty most of the debris manually from the vacuum itself into a regular trash can before placing it on the base station. The charging base station comes in auto mode to empty the vacuum when placing in on the base station. This can become quite annoying because every time I place the vacuum on the charging station, it goes into the bag empty mode which is quite loud. I’ve now switched it to manual mode by pressing the Select Mode button on top of the base station. Now when I place the vacuum on the base station to charge, I don’t have to worry about it going into the bag empty mode. You also can’t remove the vacuum from the base station until it goes through the complete cycle. With it being in manual mode now, I don’t have to worry about that anymore. The vacuum also comes with an app that allows you to see the charging status, vacuum history, and other useful information. It was a bit tricky setting it up. I scanned the QR code on that’s located on the vacuum. It automatically took me to the App Store where I was able to download the app. Once I was able to open the app, it then asked me to create an account. Locating my vacuum was easy. I scanned the same QR code again using the app. By using the app to scan the QR code, it now adds the vacuum to your account. The tricky pars was setting up the WiFi. You have connect to the vacuum’s built in WiFi. When it asks for a password you have to type the last 4 characters of the WiFi name of your device twice with no spaces. After that, then the WiFi process is complete. Overall I’m pleased with the vacuum. With the power being slightly lower than what I expected, it has other features that make up for it. It’s still a bit on the pricey side though."

No worrying about a kid not putting it on the charger because there is a spare battery charging all the time. No excuses about a full canister because it empties itself when you put it away.

bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,4,9/8/2022 14:18,LouRevue,A bit pricey but great vacuum for your home,"This is more of a vacuum station than just a regular old vacuum. It's a bit pricey but it's still a great vacuum for your home. 

This is your typical stick vac with a auto-emptying hub. It's quite nice in that you can empty the vacuum manually however, the base station had a feature where you can auto-empty it whenever you dock the vacuum. The base station itself looks good and looks refined. It's not just some gaudy tower that you shove in a corner and have it looking like an eye sore. With the different color options, you could color coordinate it with your decor if you wanted to so that it's stands out less. the footprint of the base station is pretty small so you can store it anywhere really without it getting in the way. 

Included with the vacuum are your usual attachments like a crevice tool as well as a floor scrubber which is nice. It doesn't vacuum up the liquid so it's really just a scrubber. There is a separate head attachment for the scrubber as well as some extra velcro pads to use on the scrubbing head. The attachments store inside the base station except the scrubbing head which attaches to the side. This also comes with an extra bag and filter for the vacuum. 

Another nice feature is the extra battery. You store/charge the battery in the top of the unit so if you need to vacuum the whole place, you won't have to worry about running out of power midway through. This works ok for cleaning out your automobile too since it's portable however it's a tab bulky to get into some corners. 

Last feature is the compressor. With practically all these bagless vacuums, the center filter eventually gets clogged with debris so you need to disassemble the unit and clean that out properly to ensure proper suction. There is a lever on the bin that moves up and down on the compressor which allows you to scrape off a good chunk of debris on the interior filter without needing to disassemble it which I found to be quite beneficial. You'll still need to disassemble the unit for proper maintenance however, with this cleaner, you can do it far less. 

Only real knock to the is the price tag. It is expensive for a vacuum and you could easily find a stick vac or even a larger corded vacuum for much cheaper. That said, this is more of a lifestyle item where you can have a great functioning vacuum and have it look good in your home."

The vacuume works well on lighter duty cleaning such as bare floors, thin carpets and furniture. Reluctantly gets plugged easily on medium to heavy duty jobs. The storage tower was a great idea but there isn't any place to store the floor steamer attachment. To me, I feel it's missing the bang for your buck."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,6/1/2022 18:39,Newtoradar,Self emptying convenience,It's awesome! Pricey but well worth the convenience of self emptying station along with the vacuum cleaner that cleans pretty well.
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,6/12/2022 11:31,MarkusMN,The All In One of Vacuums,"I have tried several vacuums and they have all their pros and cons. This is a very well designed and thought out system. It ranges from a compact vacuum cleaner to powerful upright with telescoping tubes for easy storage. 

The charging station serves multiple purposes as it holds the main unit, charges the vacuum, stores a charged spare battery, empires the dust compartment and has ample storage for the attachments.  The machine snaps right in place and plays a tone to assure you that it’s in place.  

The vacuum itself does a nice job on all surfaces. It has a power button to up the suction, but the normal setting works well for most jobs.  The cleaning head is smaller than normal, but this is a big plus for cleaning around corners, under furniture and other tight spots.  

One feature that really separates from the others is the spinning polishing head.  It has a water compartment with two spinning cloth pads to polish and clean linoleum, tile and wood floors. With two settings for water flow, it never saturated the floor and did a great job of putting just the right amount of moisture to do the job. The pads are easily removable and can be cleaned and reused.  

Finally, the battery life seems to be very good. I have been testing it for almost a week and I have yet to see the battery meter move.  

If you’re looking for an all in one solution, this is it."

bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,4,5/28/2022 17:20,BeingHonest,Versatile. Good suction. Extra cleaning steps.,"Pro:
-Lightweight and versatile
-Storage compartments in the tower
-Auto empty
-Battery life

Con:
-Suction could be better
-A lot of maintenance 
-Small dirt canister
-Bag costs
-Will not pick up larger debris
-Mop attachment is for light cleaning only

The Vacuum
The vacuum is lightweight and versatile. The multi position extending pipe can be detached, turning it into a handheld vac. It comes with the standard head, the crevice and brush attachment, the mop head, and a cleaning brush. The dust canister is small and the Kompressor is really just a ring that you push down to scrape the dust off the filter and compress it down. 

The Tower
The tower is the all in one serving as storage, charger, and auto emptying the vacuum. Aesthetically it’s nice and that doesn’t take up a lot of space. The sides open up for accessory storage, but it can only store the crevice, brush, and pet head attachment. The mop head is hung on a hook on the outside. The top opens up for the secondary battery charging. 

The main feature of the tower is the auto empty function which automatically empties out the dust from the vacuum and into a dust bag on the bottom. The bag is about the size of a bag of coffee, and two is included. An additional pack of three costs $20. It does a good job of fully emptying the dust canister, but it can be loud if only for less than 30 seconds. 

Cleaning
The suction could be better. While it can be powerful at max setting, I find that my other stick vacuum of the same price outperforms this one. On carpet, especially if you have pets, I find the suction on normal and medium somewhat disappointing. It’ll pick up surface level and some hair but it won’t pick up fine dust unless I activate Turbo mode. With Tubo on, it did pick up dust deep in the carpet but I have to go over the area a few times. On normal the battery will last about 30 mins, while Turbo will last about 10 mins.

On hard wood and tiles, normal was good enough, but the head would not pick up larger debris and just ends up pushing it around. 

The mop attachment is only good light cleaning. It only spins at one speed and can only use water. The amount of water can be adjusted between two settings or off.  It’s good enough for cleaning the bathroom floor or removing shoe prints of tiles. 

Maintenance
There’s quite a bit of parts that need regular maintenance. The vacuum has two dust filters that need to be cleaned along with the dust canister filter. The tower also has two filters along with having to change out the dust bags. The mop pads need to be hand washed. 

Is it worth it?
If you really detest the idea of having to empty the canister with your hands and like having the tower to store everything neatly, then yes. The vacuum is light and versatile, giving you an around cleaner. The suction is powerful at max, but there are others that can outperform it. To me, this vacuum adds more steps for the sake of convenience. Rather than emptying out the canister after use, eventually you’ll end up having to open up the tower to replace the bag and have more filters to clean out. Add to that the cost of additional bags."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,4,5/22/2022 13:51,KKCNIck,Almost perfect Whole Home Vacuum,"Vacuum for the whole home. I have 2 regular vacuums. A stick vacuum and a small cordless D***Bust** vacuum. I was hoping this would replace them so I can have one system to clean all the areas of our busy home. The setup was pretty easy but there was not a master set of instructions, so it was just open this and find out where it goes kind of install. After 20 minutes it was complete. I did have extra parts but they were for replacement filters and maintenance as I found in the manual. I downloaded the LG ThinQ app and paired the unit to my phone. Took about 15 minutes and 2 tries but finally connected. 

Use: I like the main vacuum brush for cleaning the main area of the home. The whole unit is comfortable to hold and not too heavy. I like that it is just small enough to fit in all the areas in my home where we vacuum. Most of the floor is Tile and LVT. We also have pets so there tends to be a lot of hair to pick up. In the first use I filled the container up in 20 minutes. There was a beeping noise to alert me that it was full. I set it in the base unit, and it auto emptied. This was where everything started to click. I can just pick it up vacuum and set it in the base when it is full. That is all. Not having to plug in the wall and hold the cord was helpful in getting the chore done fast. Then I used the smaller brush attachment to clean the harder to reach areas of the floor. Each time emptying in the base unit. Finally, I attached the mop unit and mopped the floor. It seemed like it would polish the floor and take up any shoe marks, but I did not notice any benefit from the mopping function. The following days I used it to clean little area’s that I would see more pet hair building. Just being able to grab and go is nice. I feel like this is almost perfect. I wish there were more color options and that the main brush unit was a little wider. In all it keeps my 2900 sq ft home clean and both batteries are more than enough to clean it.

Pros:
Cordless
Condenses multiple cleaning tools
Light weight
Long battery life
Auto Empties waste

Cons:
Wish it was less dust prone on the top of the base unit
Wish there were more colors
Wish the Mop function was stronger
Wish the Container held more"
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,4,6/1/2022 15:39,BigA,Step up but would have expected more for the price,"First there is not a lot that I can say bad about the stick vacuum. As a vacuum it does a good job. I have had better but no major complaints.  I will say on bare floors with any type of small particles it takes at least a couple of passes to get everything up but it’s not that much worse than other I’ve had (note that this is in the standard mode, you can use the turbo mode and it much better but you suffer in battery.
Pros 1. The extra battery is really nice no one room left and the battery dies. 2. The adjustable stick means that both me and my wife can use it at a comfortable level.  3.  The self evacuating chamber no more spill dust around the trash when emptying. 4. The WiFi connection with the lg apps more cool than any great benefit.
The marginal 1. The mop feature - while this is a great feature it performance is just ok, it clean most of the stuff however there is no ability to saturate or scrub. Those would have been nice and problem been a game changer
Now the con - 1. The size of the base is huge it takes some floor or wall space to store. Much larger than anything else I’ve seen. 2.  I did have a clog at the bend to the floor attached that required some time to break free.  Turn out to be balled up tape with a bunch of stuff attached.  3. And probably most important is the cost at 1K I think there are better option on the market.  I honest would go with one of the cheaper LG models and give up the self emptying canister and mop feature and save 500 to 600, however if you could find one on sale in the 700 range it would be worth it."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,3,6/1/2022 20:39,mskelbel,CordZero,"I wanted to love this system. First of all, It took a while to unbox and set up this unit. The base's sides open to component storage. The top holds a battery charger for the 2nd battery. It's all quite compact and lovely when set up. I was surprised at the size of the capture bag in the base. It's smaller than I expected, but this about the dirt/debris being compacted into this bag so I imagine that it will take quite some time to fill it up.

Now, lets move on to the vaccuum itself I was excited to use it. I turned it on and gave it a push across the carpet that I vaccuumed and shampooed four days ago. I've had some powerful suction vaccuums including a pretty good cordless stick vac. This wasn't as powerful as I was expecting. I clicked the + to boost power, it was better but still not as great as I was expecting. I ran it for about 8 minutes and it started sounding weird, power going up and down and it shut off then beeped. There was a red light on the front flashing. It indicated a clog. I took the motor off the pole and saw a clog, pet hair, at the top of the neck. I tried and tried to get it out, even used a chopstick to pull out the clog. I could only pull out so much so I started pushing the rest to move down to the dirt canister. There's a lever to push down the dirt. It seemed like a really cool idea. However once this clog cleared the neck it is now stuck above that lever. I let it run and run to try to get it free, but no such luck. Maybe eventually it will clear. 

I then tried the mop feature. The instructions said to use water, no cleaning solution. I didn't get the clean I was hoping for and had to hand wash the mop heads had to be done before I was half done with my kitchen was actually rather disappointing. 

For the price, $999 I was expecting so much more from this system. It will be passable for light cleaning but if you have pets, or have deeper cleaning needs, I can't recommend."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,7/29/2022 20:01,Awesomeness,Great buy!,Most valuable piece of equipment in the house! With pets quick cleaning is essential... LG has come up with the best solution for quick clean and dispose!
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,5/24/2022 21:55,DMNFL,Space Saver and Great Features,"The LG - CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum is a great vacuum for my entire house.  I had a stick vacuum and a traditional vacuum and I used them in different levels of the house (upstairs/downstairs).  I have all hard floors downstairs and all carpet upstairs.  So I kept the regular vacuum upstairs and the stick vacuum downstairs, which I considered inferior to the stick for carpet.  Don't get me wrong, the stick vacuum that I had worked well, but the regular vacuum was better on carpet.  This LG - CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum solved the need for having two.  The LG - CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum works as well on carpet as my traditional vacuum and as well on hard floors as my stick vacuum.  The power is what I need for all of it.

The thing that I like the most is that this automatically empties when you put it back in the tower.  I never realized how convenient this is.  You just put it back in and it empties and the tower tells you when to empty the bag.  The battery life has been great and there is a second battery and a place in the tower to charge it, so you never have a time that the vacuum is out of commission.  The app is also great.  Connection was easy it has many stats, down to how many times you've used it and how long it ran.  I would recommend the The LG - CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum to anyone."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,3,7/29/2022 16:50,Review,Review,"I love the technology, but the suction power is low on the spectrum.  Disappointing, but nicely designed.  I’ll use it and my Dyson together."
bestbuy,LG A939KBGS,5,5/19/2022 23:55,DarR,Ingenious!,"My vacuum, mops and cleaning accessories are all stored in a messy cabinet and are not very accessible. This cord zero does not only clean our messy 3-child home, it also organizes our cleaning tools to keep the house clean.  

The station itself looks good. This all-in-one station is not something I can and should keep in the closet—and I actually like it that way. It looks good out in a corner where we can easily pull the vacuum out for cereal grain spills. The design looks neat, the other nozzles and connecting tools can be stored in the station compartments, and the vacuum automatically charges once you park it. The vacuum can automatically empty itself (or you can manually trigger it). It even has a charging / storage for an extra battery which, all you clean freaks with kids out there know how important it is to have a charged EXTRA BATTERY. 

Performance-wise, it is great. I have to use it on TURBO all the time though. The normal mode just does not cut it for me. Maybe I can use that to suck other things? I don’t even know what “other” things are. All I know is, when it comes to vacuuming, it’s either it sucks it or it doesn’t. The turbo does it and for cleaning regularly a 1500 sq ft space of wood floor, I have never encountered having to even use the spare battery.  Another winner for me is the mop tool. You pre-wet the attachment cloths, put water in the bin and I mop away! There is no turbo mode for mopping, but it does the job as well! And I have been using the mop for 40 -45 minutes at a time and I do not run out of battery. This is me going through each sliver of space, slowly on the floor and it mops nicely and consistently. Oh, best of all, it is CORDLESS. I do not have to keep transferring the plug or have to hold a cord up and around me to get mopping done.

This is just so well-thought out. Even the bags and filter replacement system is easy (which we have not really done after a week of use, because we don’t think about it--- the vacuum empties itself, remember?) It makes the lady of the house happy, and it makes us all happy too. 

We just threw away all our cleaning appliances—corded mops and other vacuum sticks. This is what design is supposed to be. All-in-one—It just made cleaning fun and easy."

bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,5/4/2021 17:11,TECHBEENGOOD,"High performance, Full Featured, Value Loaded Vac","LG CordZero A9 Wet/Dry Cord-Free Stick Vacuum with Kompressor Technology.

Is it OK to use the words “value” and “premium” in the same sentence? If so, I’m going to declare that this LG CordZero A9 represents a distinct value in the upper range of premium stick vacs. As my review illustrates, the LG is serious performer, matching any other stick vac on the market, but the gifts keep coming in the form of numerous effective accessories.

OUT - OF - THE - BOX: With only a few peeks at the very well done instructions (laminated, easy-to-understand, and a suction cup to hang them!!!), the vacuum stand “clicked” together. See pictures. In fact, everything made perfect sense so we put it together and let the batteries reach full charge and then moved on to the vacuum, itself. When all put together, a 15 minute task, it’s a neat, attractive set of accessories, along with a pretty stick vac charging at the same time the EXTRA BATTERY is also charging. It is well thought out. 

PERFORMANCE: This is a premium performance vacuum in its POWER MODE. NORMAL MODE is probably fine for bare floors, but most carpets will require the POWER MODE. TURBO MODE is for those of you who vacuum less often or are cleaning up in the aftermath of an especially messy event. In every case, the LG is extremely easy to maneuver. It is much more comfortable than a standard upright, but it picks up a variety of debris as effectively as the best vacuums we’ve ever used. The extending pipe is convenient and is very easy to use. The fit and finish of all the vacuum parts hints at a lengthy lifespan for the LG. There are no lights, however, to highlight dust, on the standard power head. The mop head does have an array of lights along the front. The battery life when used at its POWER MODE setting seemed very reasonable, approaching 20 minutes with the included POWER HEAD on a mix of floors. And, then there is the 2nd battery which has been charging in the storage cradle. The stable storage cradle, by the way, does NOT need to be attached to a wall, but it has the fittings included if you prefer a permanent mount location. The power cord is not more than a few feet long, after it exits the stand, but it worked for us.

Emptying the clear canister is a simple button push. The filter assembly includes a pre-filter, the fine dust filter and the cyclonic mesh filter which are all fully washable. Just don’t try to wash the dust bin; it can only be wiped clean. Oh, and that Kompressor? Well, if your canister is too full and you want to capture some space without running to empty it, you have a sliding ring operated by the push actuator which packs the canister contents so they free up some space. Cute. It works. Not a game changer but more thoughtful design from LG. More helpful are the various indicators on the handle letting you know if there is a clog, if the filters need attention, Wi-Fi connectivity, and the battery level light trio. [That Wi-Fi allows connection to an App. We didn't even try. Sorry.]
 
MOPPING: Along with a premium vacuum with exceptional performance there is a stunning, premium quality, wet mop accessory. This head feeds an adjustable amount of WATER (only) into the pad attached by velcro to two spinning disks. An elegant, easy-to-use attachment that extends the usefulness of the LG A9. It simply works. And LG tosses into the package a 2nd set of pads. There is even a cup for filling the mop reservoir. Nice.

NOISE LEVEL: We prefer vacuums that don’t make us regret having to clean. Of course all vacuums will create noise, but the LG is reasonable at (my uncalibrated iPhone noise App) 71dB on NORMAL, 75dB on POWER, and 83 dB on TURBO. These are not loud sounds and more importantly, they are not annoying. The mop head is very quiet, managing only 55dB, which wouldn’t wake a napping baby. 

SUMMARY: I implied at the beginning of my review that a premium priced product might not also be a value. But, the LG CordZero A9 Wet/Dry Cord-Free Stick Vacuum with Kompressor Technology is so effective and convenient to use that it replaces a number of other tools. Everything works rather well. While nothing could make vacuuming fun, the LG at least makes it less of a chore. And, it doesn’t just vacuum. It’s a mop, able to dry or wet mop our tile and wood floors for the ultimate cleaning. This is a nice package that delivers on its promise. We like it a lot."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,5/14/2021 1:19,stevefromtheburbs,"Best vacuum system overall, you'll want to keep it","I've been the primary cleaner at my house, for 26 years of marriage, and for many years before that. And in all of those years, I've had many vacuums, both corded and cord free. I've had canister vacs, stick vacs, full size corded upright vacs. And in all of these years, until now, I could not say I met one that I'd want to keep because they all lacked something that I felt was important. Maybe it was a lack of place to store the accessories. Or maybe it was because the battery would run out too soon. Maybe it was because to charge it, I had to dedicate more of my kitchen counter to charging. Certainly none ever had spare batteries and if they did, they ended up also on my kitchen counter charging with all the other stuff that gets charged all the time. Well, that has all been solved. 

This model from LG includes everything you'll need or want, I promise you this will not disappoint you. It comes with two batteries, yes. Both are long use batteries. The first battery will get you an hour of clean time. If you use turbo, it's like 7 minutes. But you won't use turbo mode very often. Mostly the lowest power is all you'll need for anything but thicker carpet. For thicker carpet pile, you'll go medium mode. I used turbo to clean the dust from my bathroom exhaust fan, my HEPA filters, and a few other things. But that is not often. No worries though, if you do that as I did, you have a 2nd fully charged battery waiting for you as that 2nd battery charges on the stand....seriously! And you'll find you can get through most of your vacuuming by using both batteries - some will never use the 2nd battery, but it is there if you need it. But while you are cleaning, if you've tapped into the 2nd battery, the first is again charging on the stand while you are using the vacuum. 

This is a first, but this comes with a charging stand. Yes! A stand that is completely free standing. No need to mount to the wall or prop up the vac to charge. The stand has a heavy base that keeps it from toppling over. And to prevent it from being too tall and top heavy, they have built in a slide that allows the vacuum to be used by shorter folks, or taller folks, and to charge you simply slide it down to the shortest position. Smart! 

So my adult daughter who is 5'1"" and me at 6', can both use the same vacuum. Sounds silly but one of us was always frustrated with the height of the vac thing. It makes a difference because if it is something that is comfortable to use, you'll stay with it longer. This unit is heavy enough, but light enough at the same time. 

The actual process of vacuuming will leave you in amazement of how much stuff it gets up, that you didn't know was being left behind. In particular, I found the dust coming up was more than I ever got out before and didn't know was present because no other vacuum was getting up this kind of dust. The one picture below will show you what I mean. It starts on the lowest power mode, one tap up and you'll get medium, and if you want turbo, hold the + sign for 3 seconds and you'll get turbo. The pics shown below are after having cleaned with another vacuum first, so what you see would have been missed, and we vacuum multiple times a day due to our long haired dogs. It isn't like we vacuum once a week or something. Our long haired German Shedder as she's been called, or our long haired chihuahua produce enough hair and dust/dander to keep anyone who cleans, frustrated at the never ending mess left behind. (God knows I'd be lost without them, they are a real blessing, but the cleaning part is very frustrating). This unit helps to reduce that frustration by removing more debris when I do clean. 

Anyway, this model comes with a crevice and a dust/combo tool, an extra cloth filter, and the mop related accessories. Other packages come with other stuff, like no mop related stuff, but a powered mattress/couch/chair/stair tool. The mop part of this is not as helpful in my case, because it only uses water and cloth mop heads to move somewhat slowly around to give you a cleaning agent free, water based, dust removal finish to your floors. Frankly, with my dog situation, and my adult children who aren't as neat as I would like, we have more of a need for high speed, cleaner based mopping needs. Most however, will find this useful if they aren't faced with the same challenges. This will get dirt off of the floor and onto the cloth pads, yes, but will not suffice as a replacement for a mop to mop up spills or to get dirty dried on stuff spilled on the floor that was overlooked at the last meal. It is more like a wet dust mopping. The floor must be dry and free of hair and stuff because it only swirls around and no vacuum assist during the mopping action. 

Getting past that, the power head for the vacuum does NOT have a problem with hair clinging to it and I can attest to this fully as my dogs hair normally clogs up most power heads. They normally leave little space for it to get from the roller to the tank, and then the hair starts a downward spiral of getting clogged up - this does NOT suffer from this effect. In fact, I was shocked to see that when I looked, the power head had zero backup going on, as if it was still brand new. This is a very good thing for me because I cannot tell you how many times I've had to take over power heads apart and clean, like every 2nd or 3rd day. Very frustrating. 

One really cool feature is the Kompressor bar. Sounds like a gimmick but it isn't. While simple, this has never been done before, it presses all that stuff down while you are out vacuuming, so that all that hair that would have taken up the tank, is pressed down and compressed into the small amount of space it really needs, thereby reducing the trips to the trash can to empty! Genius and most certainly appreciated! This is no gimmick, this is really helpful and will allow you to keep going, which is part of the reason I get frustrated cleaning because of all the trips back to the can to empty. This takes away that frustration! 

Another cool and non-gimmicky feature is the WIFI and app. Why? Well besides seeing how much time you really spend vacuuming, which it documents how long and what speeds you used and for how long, it has a smart diagnosis function. Run that and make sure your unit is working as it should. Frequent tips for common problems will show up if you don't have any issues, and if you do have problems, it would show you what to do to troubleshoot and resolve them. You would simply add this to the app as another appliance/device in your home, and then once the vac is connected, WIFI remains on unless you turn it off. Once your vacuuming is done and returned to the base, it'll send you a push notification when it is fully charged. Very handy and much appreciated. In my case I had some trouble adding this to the app, I had to delete the app and re-install it for some reason, I believe this is a one-off problem and not the common thing. You will not have to relearn all of your devices should you have to do this as the devices will re-appear when you re-install the app, also something that is much appreciated. The Thin Q app from LG has come a long way from its inception, it is a handy app for all of your LG stuff that is WIFI connected. 

I know there are things I'm forgetting to tell you about, as this is a full featured cleaning system, not just a vacuum. It fills the void by providing all of the things you will want from your primary vacuum. The beauty of buying from BestBuy is their liberal return policy, which for an investment such as this, you'll want to know can be used if for some reason you find this doesn't fit your needs. But trust me when I tell you, after spending decades being the primary cleaning person, with lots of vacuuming hours under my belt, and always wanting to be able to say ""This one has it all"", I find myself thinking this is really the be all end all for vacuums. 

The part about the adjustable vacuum height should not be overlooked. As I've aged and put on a few extra pounds, my back hurts more often than it used to. Using similar looking vacuums makes my back hurt because of the height of the vacuum and the top heaviness of them. This adjustable height and very balanced feel of this vacuum has allowed me to vacuum for longer without my back hurting. Anyone with back issues will understand you try to find things and ways to prevent this from happening as quickly. This seemingly small feature is a very big deal for me. And my daughter, who is only 5'1"" echoes my sentiments on this topic."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,4,5/14/2021 22:43,jago,"Great features, just a little shy of perfect.","This is a fantastic addition to the arsenal in my mission to keep my floors clean. I have two dogs and two little girls. The constant state of messes that engulfs my floors is staggering and I am always looking for something to help make the fight easier. The LG CordZero A9 is a big leap forward for me and preforms a lot better than my older cordless stick vacuum (another famous brand). This vacuum is definitely in the top of the preforming ones out there and unfortunately, the price also reflects that. However, at its premium price, it also is packed with a lot of value and features. 

This is geared more towards regular carpet and hard floors (tile, wood, etc.). However, the main vacuuming head is built more for carpet so it does struggle with picking up big pieces on hard floors at time, a soft roller would be better. There is a model that has a soft roller that comes with it and I think that would have been a better fit for this model since the mop attachment does not suck up anything so you must vacuum first, and the soft roller head would seem like it belongs with this set up. Despite that, cleaning the floors with the mop attachment is easy and does a great job. 

LG provides just about two of everything here. You get two sets of mop attachments, two sets of filters so you can clean a set and have one on the ready. Speaking of twos…you are given two batteries here and with the floor stand, you can charge both at the same time! That is one of the greatest features that I enjoy. You will always have a battery ready for the job at hand. Running time ranges between 60 minutes down to 7 minuets per battery depending on the power setting. Normal mode gives you the longest running time, but the suction is just about average. When you step it up to Power mode, you get about 13 minutes for each battery, and I feel this is the mode I use the most. Turbo mode is what I kick it in when I need to hit the high traffic areas and I never ran it down to zero in that mode but estimates around 7 minutes per battery is what I have seen. 

Another great feature I like is that there is a power button that you can toggle on and off, so you do not have to keep holding down a trigger button some my older stick vacuum. The placement of the power button could be in a better spot, I feel. I found my self accidently hitting it when placing the A9 back on the charging stand or when I am emptying out the dust bin, not a big deal but something to think about. There is no auto mode and that seems like a feature that all the other premium vacuums in this price range seem to have now. To manually shift between the power modes, you just need to hit the + and – buttons below the power button, in order to activate Turbo mode, you must hold down the + button for 3 seconds. This vacuum also has Wi-Fi abilities built in and you can toggle that by holding down the – button for 3 seconds. 

The LG ThinQ App will connect to the vacuum and you can run diagnostics on the vacuum, it will show you usage duration that is broken down into the different modes and how long each mode was running. It will also display if the attached battery is charging. I like the LG ThinQ app and I find it useful since it can also connect to other LG products, for example, my TV and my refrigerator both connect to the app as well, so I did not just have to download it for one device. 

Despite all of the good with this, there are a few things I feel that could improve this greatly. A more accurate battery indicator would be great, this only has three bars of power and other premium devices have an actual percentage or even an estimated time remaining. A larger dust bin would be nice, and the kompressor built into the dust bin will smash down the debris, but it would be nice to have more space. The last thing on my wish list would be some LED lights on the main vacuum head. It comes in handy when you are vacuuming dark places or under furniture. I feel at this price range, those features should be included as well. I will still recommend this to my friends and family though since it is not as expensive as some others out there, but its performance overall is really good. 

Pros:
Suction
Attachments
Charging stand (2 batteries at once)
Mopping function
spare washable filters included
laminated quick guides

Cons:

Lack of LED lights
battery indicator
small dust bin
power button location
lack of auto mode"
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,8/24/2021 14:22,Curmudgeon,VIGOROUS VACUUM – MARVELOUS MOP – 2 BATTERIES,"The LG CordZero A9 Kompressor Stick Vacuum with Power Mop is an innovative evolution of the A9 stick vacuum product line.

This model is not a “wet/dry” vacuum which is capable of ingesting both dry material and liquids (like shop vacuums typically do).  The “wet” reference for this stick vacuum actually refers to the Power Mop attachment which operates with the vacuum motor turned off.

The LG CordZero A9 Kompressor arrives very well packed and includes the vacuum motor power head, an aluminum telescoping extension wand (20” collapsed, 29.5” extended), a universal power nozzle (for carpet and bare floors), a combination tool (with removable brush), a crevice tool, a power mop attachment, a free-standing / wall mountable storage stand with integral battery charger, two lithium ion rechargeable batteries, four microfiber floor scrubbing pads (for the power mop), a brush for cleaning the dirt collection canister and motor housing, and a measuring cup with custom shaped spout for filling the water tank of the power mop.

Assembly of the charging stand is straightforward, and LG provides a quantity of printed product documentation.  The stand has a weighted base, which I found to be very stable.  The stand may also be wall mounted.  The hardware for wall attachment is included.  Notably, all of the included components and accessories are accommodated on the charging stand!  Even the mop pads and cleaning brush have a home.  

The combination tool and crevice tool attachments can be used with or without the telescoping extension wand, easily accommodating cleaning out of reach areas, as well as close-up cleaning tasks such as upholstered furniture.  The telescoping wand provides four latching positions.  All of the attachments easily snap together and latch securely.

Cordless stick vacuums are particularly attractive and desirable for their light weight, easy maneuverability and superior convenience.  The LG CordZero A9 Kompressor excels in those attributes.  

The vacuum weighs only 5.95 lbs, with most of the weight concentrated in the motor unit.  The handle is large and comfortable.  The thumb operated power on/off switch and motor speed control switches (+ / -) are conveniently located.  Switches only require momentary depression and do not need to be held continuously during operation as some stick vacuums require.

Both the power vacuum nozzle and power mop attachments are equipped with a ball-gimbal mount which affords outstanding maneuverability and directional control.  The CordZero easily reaches under low furniture, and is easily maneuvered next to walls and furnishings for excellent edge cleaning.

The power vacuum nozzle contains a motorized 9” brushroll which operates at all times for both carpeted and hard surface floors.  A pair of small rollers facilitates movement on carpeting, but nevertheless, there are times when forward motion required additional physical effort.  I found that a high angle of attack exacerbated that issue, and lowering the angle of the stick vacuum reduced the level of required effort.  However, I also found that lowering the angle of attack often necessitates bending slightly to lower the handle/stick.  This created an occasional annoyance.  This issue does not result from the telescoping extension wand being too short.  Rather, it is a product of the design of the leading edge of the of the power nozzle which can embed in carpet pile.

LG provides a specification of 200 watts of suction power.  If LG is actually describing an air watts rating, 200 watts is double the required 100 air watt standard for upright vacuums, and is only slightly below the 220 air watt standard for canister vacuums.

I found the suction power to be more than adequate.  The CordZero provides three motor speeds (power levels) labeled as Normal, Power and Turbo.  The default, Normal mode proved to be extremely effective on both hard and carpeted surfaces.  The Power and Turbo motor speeds reduce battery run-time and increase noise level.

LG claims 60 minutes of operation (per battery) in Normal mode, 40 minutes in Power mode and 12 minutes in Turbo mode.  The power unit of the vacuum has an LED display with 3 incremental bars for battery capacity.  After 55 minutes of use, divided between vacuuming in Normal mode and power mop operation (single, non-adjustable operating speed), the LED displayed 2 bars of remaining battery capacity.  I therefore believe that with the two included batteries, whole house cleaning is well within expectations.

The lithium ion, batteries are 25.2 volt, 2.4 Ah / 60.48 Wh (2.3 Ah / 57.96 Wh minimum) capacity.  Replacement batteries are expensive so they should be properly maintained.  Battery charging is accommodated by charging one battery while attached to the vacuum motor unit as well as the second battery in the charging stand.  Batteries are not charged simultaneously;  they are charged sequentially.  The charging stand first charges the battery which is attached to the vacuum, and upon completion, then charges the second battery in the stand.  Each battery requires 3.5 – 4 hours to fully charge (7 – 8 hours to charge both batteries).

Completion of charging of each battery is annunciated by LED indicators (3 incremental LED bars on the vacuum handle for attached battery, and a single LED on the charging stand for second battery).  Completed charging of the primary battery is also annunciated by a push-notification to the available LG Thin-Q smartphone app.  The built-in LED panel also shows the progress of charging, the need for filter cleaning, detection of a clogged vacuum flow-path and indicates if wi-fi is active.

I already had the Thin-Q app installed on my LG smartphone.  Nevertheless, it required four attempts to finally connect the vacuum with the app via wi-fi.  The CordZero communicates only on 2.4GHz wi-fi.

The Thin-Q app tracks usage of the CordZero by date and cleaning sessions, reporting total hours/minutes of use.  It also displays the duration of use in each of the three power modes, and notifies the user when filters require cleaning.  Additional data granularity might be useful, such as displaying the duration of individual cleaning sessions, rather than just the grand total of each day’s use.  

The Thin-Q app displays when the battery attached to the vacuum is being charged and when it is fully charged.  It does not provide any additional battery status data such as the remaining capacity of the battery (% remaining), and when charging, the progress of the charge (% charged – time remaining to 100%).  There is no information for the second battery.

The power mop has a motorized base unit which attaches to the telescoping wand.  A water reservoir snaps on top.  Either of the fill plugs can be used to fill the tank with the included measuring cup.  Only water is permitted in the reservoir;  no cleaners or chemicals can be used.  A rocker switch controls selecting high-flow or low-flow dispensing of water to the scrubbing pads.  The included microfiber mop pads attach to the rotating disks on the bottom of the mop unit with Velcro.  LG includes four scrubbing pads, and additional pads are very inexpensive on the LG Parts website (before shipping charges).

The water flow switch effectively meters the dispensing of water from the tank via a small valve.  When used in low-flow mode the residual dampness on tile floors was minimal and dried rapidly without water spots.  In high-flow mode, additional water is dispensed to aid in scrubbing more heavily soiled areas.

I was very pleased with the results after using the power mop attachment.  The LG cannot compete with a corded, dedicated floor scrubbing/polishing machine, but for regular use in maintaining hard flooring, it appears that it will serve quite well!  I believe that spraying some detergent directly on heavy soil prior to scrubbing with the CordZero A9 power mop will be even more effective.  There is no indicator for an empty reservoir.  The smoked plastic tank must be visually monitored to determine when refilling is necessary.

Air filtration is comprised of multiple filter elements, and is listed as being 5 stage HEPA filtration.  The filters are removable and washable.  A spare pre-filter is also included.  

The small dust collection bin can fill quickly.  The CordZero A9 Kompressor employs a very unique lever operated “piston” to compress the dust and pet hair in the bin, thereby extending the intervals between emptying.

I am hopeful that the CordZero A9 proves to be durable and reliable, but of course, only time will tell.  The unit is comprised of a significant quantity of plastic components.  The latch and hinge which secure the dust collection bin appear to potentially be fragile.

Overall, the LG CordZero A9 Kompressor stick vacuum with power mop is excellent.  It is compact, lightweight, easily maneuverable and efficient.  It is powerful, yet not unpleasantly noisy.  It is well-equipped with accessories which attach with ease, and all of which have dedicated storage places on the included charging/storage stand.  The two large capacity batteries provide approximately two hours of run-time, which is more than adequate for thoroughly cleaning a large house.  The vacuum cleaning power and efficiency are great, and the power mop performs very nicely and delivered clean, shiny floor tiles without water spots.

I believe that you will be just as thoroughly pleased and satisfied with the CordZero A9 Kompressor stick vacuum with power mop as we are with ours!"
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,6/1/2021 21:55,Erik77,Powerful & quiet,"Packaging:

Really nice device with bunch of attachment accessories (washable filters, brush, mop attachment with fiber towel and cleaning pads, two batteries) and standing / charging base which can be used as standing or mounted holder. Clean and simple packaging which was very easy to be assembled and ready to use after just few attachments “clicked” together. 

Impressions:

This is all you need for your house. Light and portable makes it easy to use in any area for any situation. If you have stairs this would be a life saver trust me, especially since this vacuum has detachable from its wand. We have combination of hardwood floor, vinyl and tiles and works great on all of them. Telescoping wand will help you reach to light ceiling in case some of the spider webs find a way to your home.

Overview:

This vacuum is the best I have ever tried, used or even seen. Not too loud for vacuuming and surprisingly quiet for mopping (I guarantee you won’t even hear it in the next room with door open). I think sound produced while mopping is equal to sound produced by regular cooling standards fans. I was positively surprised that is still vacuuming while mopping and result of it. We love this vacuum and all of our friends are inquiring about it. 10 years warranty on the motor and two batteries are big plus. 

Pros:

Powerful
Quiet
Vacuum and Mop
Detachable
Extending Wand
2 batteries
10 year warranty on motor

bestbuy,LG A929KVM,3,6/2/2021 22:51,Mookie,"Vacuum?...meh, Mop?...false","I'm not sure how long it's been since cordless vacuums like this have hit the market. My wife and I have owned a regular old upright, bagless vacuum for probably 15 years. It's long past time for a change. Just turning on the old vacuum anymore smells like cheese, Fritos, and dog. There have been numerous different vacuum/mop combos my wife has been watching lately. We have pets too so the mop attachment was a big draw for her.
She's heard from her friends, and reviews online that the cordless vacuums like this leave a lot to be desired. After using this vacuum, we've discovered they make a very strong point.
I have a total of 14 steps in my tri-level. This vacuum has a stand that charges the battery in the stand, as well as in the vacuum while stored.
Once plugged into the stand there is a flashing light on the side that will flash until battery fully charged. There is a battery symbol on the handle of the vacuum with 3 bars. The bars will flash 1 by 1 until fully charged. Lets go back to my 14 steps. I started with both batteries full. This vacuum is night and day compared to our old vacuum. the extension bar removes and you are left with just the motor/battery dirt canister upon which you can use the small nozzle, or small nozzle with brush attachments. It's literally a handheld vacuum at this point, like a Dustbuster. I would say it's 3-5 lbs in this configuration.
When you turn on the vacuum, there are 3 modes, normal, medium, and turbo. You have to hold the turbo button 3 seconds to put into turbo mode. Normal and medium mode are pretty ineffective at vacuuming. This is the main problem with this vacuum, whether you're using the Dustbuster mode, or upright standing method, the most effective result is in the turbo mode. With 14 steps, 7 up, and 7 down, I barely got through all 14 steps in turbo mode before both batteries died.
Normal & medium just do not cut the mustard.
Upright vacuuming is pretty nice. You have the benefit of having a lightweight vacuum, and adjustable extension rod, which is nice to accommodate short and tall people alike. Another good point is the swivel on the vacuum attachment, you can pretty much extend underneath any bed, table, , couches, chairs.When using as upright vacuum, you really have to push during the forward movement on turbo mode, but again, it just doesn't pick up much and have the power to be effective on normal and medium, so you have to work quick to avoid batteries dying. It's frustrating that if I clean my steps, I'm stuck waiting a long time before I can vacuum the other areas of floors. Seems to be on average 2 hours to fully charge one of these batteries.
Cleaning out the canister when done is really easy. THere's a latch on the button the opens so you can dump in the garbage. There's also a red button you can push to push the dirt/lint...down the canister barrel. We were really excited about the prospect of a mop. This seems like false advertisement to even list mop in the description. It should be listed as a polisher, buffer. What makes it even more ironic is that in the manual it advises that it should to be not used as a buffing wheel, when that's the only good use for the ""mop attachment"".
You can't use soap, you can only use water, so if you don't actually mop the floor to begin with, you're just spinning around dirty hot floor water.
I would not recommend this to anyone. Benefits do not outweigh the issues. We will look for another handheld multi-purpose vacuum like this one.

bestbuy,LG A929KVM,2,12/31/2021 18:32,Nberg,Sucks at sucking,Underwhelmed for the cost. I enoy the docking station but after using this for a couple months I am considering finding something else. Works best using turbo which eats battery up so fast so to clean appropriately battery life is abysmal. Part of the plastic craped on the mop attachment. Do not even attemp to vacuum a tiny lowpile rug. Maybe I got a dud because I really wanted to like this.
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,5/14/2022 12:11,LoveGodandCountry,Great Value and Very Utilitarian,"We have owned this vacuum for less than a month. So far, it has been very convenient to have downstairs. We have wood flooring and tile. It's great for to keep the floor clean and dust free. I am a clean freak and I like to be barefoot in the house. I hate having dirt and crumbs on the floor. We have a teenage son and that stuff just seems to fall off of him. It's also a lot easier for him to use then getting the old broom and dust pan. Having two batteries is also convenient when we have to do the whole downstairs. It's also super quiet and has enough suction to do the job.

Although not as convenient as the swiffer wetjet, the wet part of the vacuum works much better to get our travertine tile clean.

With the stand, two batteries, numerous attachments, quiet operation, you can't beat this cordless vacuum at the price point."

bestbuy,LG A929KVM,4,9/7/2021 22:14,Leesah,Over priced,"I have been using this product for about three months now. It works great!  Perfect on hardwood floors. On rugs however,  it is a little tough to push around. If you have a lot of rugs in your home, it might be best to purchase a regular vacuum not a stick vacuum. As in my experience a stick vacuum works best on hardwood floors.It picks up only small debris. If you have larger pieces be careful because it will get stuck. We always have to make sure that the opening to the suction is clear. The mop portion of the vacuum, runs a little slow. I wish the motion of the brush moved faster. Initially, when I first purchased  this vacuum,  I Was under the impression that the mop portion would vacuum 
At the same time that it Mopped. But that’s not the case here. Is it worth $600 to $800?  I would have to say no. I would have to say more along the lines of $200-$300."

bestbuy,LG A929KVM,3,12/25/2021 10:03,Unsatisfied,Overall it's ok but don't buy for the mop function,"As a vacuum it's perfectly acceptable. It does require a fair amount of regular maintenance (tip clean the interior dust trap weekly) but it does a good job picking up dust and hair. It does a terrable job of picking up anything the size of a small pebble or larger and most of the time it will just spit it back out. 
The mop function on the other hand is awful. Really, don't waste the extra hundred dollars for this particular version. The water can't be controlled and just slowly drips out. Per the manual it only uses plain water so no soapy solutions to get the floors really clean. 
The one time we used the mop function, the spin head on the vacuum part stopped working the next time we tried to use it. I don't think it was related but we did have to return the unit for a replacement as a result. 
The kompressor feature is nice to push down pet hair and results in having to empty it less often but sometimes pet hair gets stuck on the other side. When that happens more gets caught up there until you take the whole inside apart and clean it out. 
Battery life is acceptable and I can usually get about 800 square feet of carpet on the second setting before one battery runs out. On the most powerful setting though I can maybe get a full bedroom before it runs out. The extra battery it includes is a bonus. Also the stand works great and has a spot to charge the spare battery when you aren't using it. 
Bottom line, this product is good but don't waste your money on the version with the mop function, for the price you can get a standalone electric mop that out performs this one by miles. Also full price is too much for this unit. I got it on sale for $550 and feel like that price is on the high end of what it is worth."

Powerful, light, flexible in use, having two battery pack, two filters, mop function. don't have to press the button all the time. Be able to select suction power, even with wifi. No more pain in my wrist. I'd love to use this one."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,9/14/2021 1:23,ellekat,Love it!,"I've had Dyson stick vacuums for years, in fact my most recent one is a brand new V11 (the last one is V6). I really like this LG one for many different reasons - 1. its charging stand can be placed anywhere and I don't have to commit to a wall space like Dyson (once you bolt that charging dock to a wall, it's kind of cumbersome to change it); 2. the mop is actually quite nice. Even at the highest ""wet"" setting, my socks don't get drenched while mopping the floor (from stepping on the freshly mopped space). It is not the most scrubbiest mopping pads, but we have new floors so this works for us for regular maintenance. If there was something really stuck on, I'd get out a spray and a rag.; 3. it's quite easy to maneuver on the floors/carpets. My Dyson V11 is a pain to vacuum with on carpets, because I think the suction is too powerful and my carpet is not super long, but it's not a berber. This LG goes on it so much easier all while cleaning well.;  4. THE LEVER ON THE CANISTER IS A GAME CHANGER. If you have Dyson, you know what I mean by this. It is so much easier to empty out the canister than the Dyson, because I don't have to go with a pen to get the rest of the clump of dust out.; 5. The easily adjustable height for the wand is nice for when I'm vacuuming the stairs. Overall, it's a great buy. There's a reason why LG is the go-to brand for appliances in Korea."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,1,6/24/2022 18:03,EPRVision,Other options may be cheaper and work better,Poor performance.  Shark and Dyson blow it away. It was expensive and not worth the expense

The mop is nice for quick clean up however i still use my mop when i want to do a really thorough cleaning.
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,4,1/11/2022 10:44,AnHonestReview,Could have been great except for a few flaws,"This CordZero vacuum is well made and high quality.  It's light weight and a breeze to use, and does great with dog hair.  You can tell the designers and engineers put a lot of effort into this, which is why I'm surprised of the obvious flaws.  We have a mix of hardwood floors and area rugs.  It has a hard time picking up small solid items on floors, a dropped aspirin for example.  It doesn't pick up the schmootz right next to the wall, and when you transition from floor to carpet, it often leaves a smear of hair and debris that you have to hit a few times to pick up. It's also hard to push on carpet; it's like the rollers don't work correctly.  It also lacks LED ""headlights"" which should be a must on all vacuums, especially at this price point.  If your vacuum doesn't have bright LED headlights, you don't know what you are missing. I love the lightweight CZ for quick, frequent, vacuuming - a must with dogs that shed - but unfortunately, this expensive little vac is not going to replace your full-sized unit unless you have all hard floors."

I am satisfied."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,4,5/6/2021 14:57,mkcar1,Decent vacuum made better with mop attachment,"There are a lot of things to like about this vacuum but to me it lags a little on suction when compared to my Dyson V11 nor does it have adjustment on power head. Neither does it “sense” carpets and adjust its suction automatically. To me what really sets this product apart, in a sea of cordless vacuums, is the mop attachment/feature, which I initially considered a gimmick - but found it works very well. Overall, I do recommend vacuum is good and you will be pleasantly surprised with the mop’s functionality.

Positives;

The packaging must be the best I have encountered. Its 3 tiers with first 2 having built in handles to help remove them. Instructions are clear and precise. Charging/component stand could not have been easier to put together with an option to mount on a wall. Very comprehensive instructions included

Comes with 2 Batteries and both can be charged at the same time - one clicking into stand and one in handle. When clicking in handle to charge there is an audible alert. Also includes 3 basic accessories – Combination tool, crevice tool and cleaning brush.

3 Power modes - Normal - Power - Turbo. I found Normal a tad weak so ran using Power mode and got just over 30 minutes use on single charge. Nice thing was I just popped in second battery to finish. Power is set up/down by pressing large easily accessed buttons on top of handle. Experienced no loss of power right up to when battery was exhausted/empty of charge. No button to hold to run – just press once to turn it on and go (are you listening Dyson?)

Extension pipe (connecting rod between handle and heads) is slide adjustable from 18 to 27 inches.

Easy to see dust bin that has a button to press that “kompresses” (hence the name compressor) the dirt allowing for more time between emptying. Just press button to open and empty. 

All 3 filters within the handle are easy to access and clean. Included is an extra Pre-filter. There is an interesting “twist” in that the crevice tool is also used to remove the mesh filter in the dust bin. 

Universal cleaning head is easy to clean as well, and size is nice for maneuvering around objects. 

Separate mop head with clear easy to see and remove/fill water reservoir. Mop pads just press into head using Velcro and extend out a little to allow for corner cleaning. VERY Quiet. You could mop floors in the middle of the night and not disturb anyone. Not that I would – but you could. I ran for over 55 minutes and still had water and power level was still at 3 bars. Comes with 2 sets of machine washable heads that can be stored on stand. Also, when using mop mode suction is turned off.

I did load and activate LG ThinQ app but honestly do not see much use at this point. It was nice to get a pop up that battery is completely charged. Maybe as it tracks usage and maintenance, I will see more value.

1-year general warranty and 10-year motor warranty.


Negatives

No indicator as to what power level you are on (no lights, etc) – had to go by sound.

Had to push extremely hard when using on thicker carpets. Found lowering handle angle helped.

Also handle seemed quite heavy making vacuum feel unbalanced (light on cleaning head). I was tired of using after 10 minutes due to the heavy handle. Luckily since you do not have to hold button to run, I could move hand around, changing my holding position.

While “kompressor” function extends times between emptying I found dust/dirt would accumulate above it requiring removal of mesh filter to clear.

No lights on cleaning head but there are on the mop head? Also due to cleaning head design it was a tad too tall to fit under a couple of shelving units. Which was not a problem with other vacuums.

While I really liked the mop feature you cannot select/change speed of cleaning heads and there is a “dry” strip in the middle of the pads. Water flow is controlled (low/off/high) by a button on the mop head, not on the handle, requiring you bend over to adjust. Also, the rotating heads can, at times, make it difficult to keep in a straight line – need to have a tight grip on handle.


Overall, this is a nice vacuum (3.5 stars) with a unique mopping feature that increases its “must have” factor (to 4 stars)."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,4,7/9/2021 15:27,Darrick,Looks like a good little portable vacuum.,Bought this to replace a Dyson cordless vac which finally died on us. Things I like cuz it comes with a second battery and it also has a bunch of attachments including a mopping one that I've yet to try. Other things I like that it's on a stand that both charges the device and the spare battery I don't have to worry about mounting it on the wall. Only use it a few times but so far so good.
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,3,6/7/2022 16:04,cyosa,Not worth it for me.,"It's really easy to use and convenient to have. I have tile floors and think it did and okay job. Not the strongest suction power but got the job done.
I think you can get something cheaper that is more powerful.
It was giving me issues within the first year. Glad I bought protection and opted for something else."

The map attachment is amazing and one of the reasons we upgraded, that and the V8 died after only 2 years. Hopefully this doesn't suffer the same fate."

bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,5/10/2021 19:31,z4teen,Premium Product and Performance at a Premium Price,"This specific CordZero A9 model (A929KVM) features LG's new Kompressor technology, as well as wi-fi capability and a powered mopping attachment. In the box, this A929KVM includes the vacuum itself; multi-mode charging stand; two removable, rechargeable batteries; two washable pre-motor filters; one washable HEPA post-motor filter; a ""universal"" power floor nozzle; a crevice tool; a 2-in-1 brush tool; a cleaning brush; wall mounting kit; and the Power Mop attachment with water reservoir, water filling cup and four reusable microfiber mopping pads. 

Right out of the box I was impressed with the build quality of each piece and the flexibility of the charging dock/stand. Unlike many competitors, the A9's charging dock can stand upright with its included heavy base, and it holds most (but not all) of the included accessories. The stand can be attached to the wall or disconnected from the base, providing a lot of flexibility. It fits perfectly in the corner of my walk-in closet and provides easy access to remove and install the vacuum. 

After fitting everything together and plugging in the charger, you simply drop one bright yellow battery into the spare battery holder on the stand and snap the other into the bottom of the vacuum. You dock and undock the vacuum (with battery attached) by sliding it up or down on the top of the base; when property docked, the vacuum plays a little ditty to let you know it's charging (the same noise my LG washer makes, which is a neat touch). The dock will first fully charge the vacuum and then fully charge the spare battery, with indicator lights on the vacuum and the stand showing the charging status. 

The charging stand also has room for the two included cleaning attachments, as well as the power mop nozzle and two of the four microfiber pads. It's all very sturdy and compact and a breeze to use -- definitely the best charging/storage solution of any vacuum I've ever used. While the vacuum charged I took a few minutes to set up the LG ThinQ app on my iPhone, which connects to the A9 via wi-fi. After a simple set up process I had no trouble at all maintaining a connection.

The ThinQ app displays charging and usage information for the A9, and will send push notifications when the A9 finishes charging or needs its filters cleaned. Usage information includes graphics displaying overall usage minutes and number of minutes at each power level, as well as lifetime usage. While neat, the information displayed is rather basic. The A9 itself displays a battery gauge and filter cleaning reminder light, so using the app for these features isn't necessary. I wish the app displayed more complex metrics like battery charge percentage and battery health status, but nonetheless, it's free, easy to use, and helps make the A9 feel that much more ""premium."" 

After allowing the vacuum to fully charge, I set off to use it for the first time. For the sake of comparison, I live in a 600 square-foot one-bedroom apartment, and I have all hard flooring surfaces with a few short-pile area rugs. I live alone and at the time of this review don't have a pet (yet).

The A9 is simple to undock, and the extendable wand is a nice touch, as it makes the vacuum more compact for storage but plenty comfortable when fully extended for use tall people like myself. Pressing the power button activates the power nozzle and the ""Normal,"" or lowest, suction level. I was pleased to find the vacuum pretty quiet on this setting, although the power nozzle makes a growling noise on hard floors, but it's nothing too objectionable. Pressing the ""+"" button once ups the suction to the ""Power,"" or medium, mode. Press and hold the ""+"" for a few seconds and you'll enter Turbo mode, which is the highest suction level. The power nozzle turns at the same speed regardless of suction level. 

On the default Normal power level, the A9 picked up just about everything I saw on the hard floors, and surface dust from my area rugs. I found pressing the ""+"" button once for Power mode picked up all the visible dust and dirt on any surface without much work on my part. I was concerned about the ""universal"" power nozzle not performing as well as separate, dedicated carpet and floor nozzles (which other A9 models include), but was pleasantly surprised to find it cleaned hard floors and area rugs really well. I was at first annoyed that LG didn't include the ""fluffy"" hard floor nozzle with this specific A9 model, but after having used the universal nozzle a few times I can't see myself missing the dedicated hard floor nozzle. The universal nozzle even picked up most of the layer of fine dust from the hard floors under my bed, which I did not expect. Even better, the universal nozzle rolls right from rug to floor to rug without switching attachments or cleaning modes, which makes vacuuming that much quicker and easier. 

After vacuuming all the floors in my apartment with the universal power nozzle, I attached the 2-in-1 brush and did some surface cleaning of tables and shelves. This attachment snaps on firmly and offers soft bristles or a hard rectangular cleaning surface. It picked up dust, fuzz and hair quite admirably from a variety of hard surfaces. I found Normal suction mode was fine for light particles, but again, the Power suction mode did a more complete job. After trimming my beard I was able to vacuum up all the little clippings quickly in Power mode with the brush attachment; I switched to the crevice tool and got everything from the corners and baseboards of my bathroom as well. Nice!

Any time I paused in my vacuuming, I gave the Kompressor button a few quick presses. This button slides down a spring-loaded device in the A9's dust cup to compress the dirt and dislodge larger pieces from the internal cyclone; it worked well in my testing and after vacuuming my entire apartment twice the dust bin was maybe half full at most. 

After vacuuming the floors and major surface areas I switched the power nozzle for the mop nozzle to finish the job. I have to admit, I was skeptical of the utility of the Power Mop Nozzle, especially since LG advises you to use only plain water (no soaps or detergents). Nonetheless, filling the reservoir is easy enough, as it snaps off the Power Mop Nozzle for filling/emptying. I used plain tap water as instructed and filled it to the max fill line. After attaching it to the Power Mop Nozzle I wet and wrung out two of the circular microfiber cleaning pads and attached them to the bottom of the nozzle, and slid the entire thing onto the end of the A9's wand. I used the ""low"" water setting, which dispenses a small amount of water onto the back of each rotating mop pad; there's also a ""high"" water setting that will dispense more water and is for cleaning heavily-soiled areas according to the manual.

I turned the A9 on and the Power Mop Nozzle illuminated its headlight and began quietly spinning its mop pads. I started in one corner of my apartment and slowly moved the A9 back and forth across the hard floors, overlapping my rows and getting into corners as needed. I quickly realized I was wrong about the mopping attachment -- this thing is great! In under 15 minutes I had mopped all the hard flooring in my unit with hardly any elbow grease on my part. The spinning motorized mop heads do all the scrubbing, while you simply glide the machine where it needs to go. The microfiber pads easily cleaned the top layer of grime off the floors, while the soft loops of fabric wiped the crevices between the floor and baseboards. The floors seemed wet enough to have been cleaned, but weren't sopping wet, and dried in a matter of minutes. All told, I used maybe 1/4 of the water in the reservoir and very little elbow grease and found myself with clean, dry, not-sticky floors. 

Finally, after all the cleaning and mopping I took a look at the battery indicator on the A9 and found I still had 2 of 3 battery bars remaining. This was using only one battery, and after vacuuming with both powered and unpowered attachments on the A9's Power (medium) suction level and then mopping with the Powered Mop Nozzle. Here I was worried about having enough charge to vacuum my whole house when I was able to vacuum, spot clean/dust and mop on one battery. 

Overall, I'm very impressed with the LG A9. It can clean all my floors and dust most of my surfaces -- and then mop the floors too -- more quickly and easily than I could with my corded vacuum and regular mop and bucket. The A9 has plenty of suction for bare floor and carpeted surfaces, and the universal power nozzle does a fine job picking up most dust and dirt on any floor type. The charging and storage stand is excellent, and the run time from the battery is much better than I hoped for. I was worried the mopping attachment would be a gimmick, but I was genuinely pleased with how well it mopped my floors, and it's both quicker and less messy than a regular mop.

My one major complaint is a lack of included furniture/upholstery attachment. LG includes a ""Power Punch Nozzle"" with other A9 models, and I wish it were included with mine for the price. The 2-in-1 tool is fine for small areas but it would take forever to clean a couch or loveseat. Something to note when you're comparing models. 

In sum, the LG A9 offers high quality, strong performance and a unique, useful powered mopping head. The two batteries offer loads of runtime and the included accessories and stand all work well. The A9 is easy to clean and will even let you know when the filters are due to be washed. This vacuum commands a premium price, and while LG offers useful additional tools, they aren't cheap. If you can stomach the price, the LG A9 is definitely worth a look in the high-end cordless vacuum market."

bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,7/16/2021 15:36,Gadgetguy1234,Beats Dyson all day!,So far so good! I think the comments about the battery not lasting long are over exaggerated. It’s been fantastic so far. This vacuum is much easier to maneuver than the dyson. Very pleased with this purchase!

bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,5/17/2021 23:24,MountainLiving,"Fantastic vacuum, solid mop attachment.","Living in the mountains and sharing my property with 12 chickens, 4 ducks, 4 cats and a dog can lead to certain challenges to maintain a clean home. So when I find something that turns out to be an exceptional addition to my arsenal of tools I can use to wage this war on filth, I gotta talk about it!

 Where to begin, let’s go all the way back to the un boxing of the item. I have an appreciation for well packaged items. All pieces we well secured for safe shipping and easy to decouple for the packing. Assembly is pretty intuitive, and the instructions are fantastic. I wish what we got here was more the norm for other items in the world. You get a super easy to follow quick laminated quick start guide. This takes a couple minutes to read and should give you all you need to know. Then you also get a detailed, extensive instruction manual if you want to dig into all the nitty gritty details. Both guides are very well written in a font big enough for my 47 year old eyes to read with fantastic diagrams and pictures. All A+ stuff in this category.

 The charging base is fantastic. It looks nice and is highly functional. You can have both your batteries stored and constantly charged. You can store most of your accessories on the base if desired. It is well built and can be set up free standing on its solid base or attached to a wall with an included bracket. Also not only do you have 2 batteries so one should always be charged and ready to go. You get to air filters and two sets of mop heads so once again, you can always have a backup ready to go if you need to switch up mid job.

 Ok now to the meat and potatoes of this review. The vacuum is fantastic. The charge time lasts longer than I can tell on the low setting. Well over an hour. I let me neighbor borrow it to see if we could kill the charge it just kept going. The medium power setting seemed more like 30 minutes while the highest setting drains power pretty quickly. Now lets talk about that POWER! Low setting is fine, easy breezy regular maintenance to keep the bulk of your debris off the floor. This high setting though is incredible. Best vacuum I have ever used. We vacuum all the time and the first time we used this thing on a rug at high power it pulled things out we never knew were there lol. Serious heft, I’m very impressed. How it is the most power vacuum I have ever used is battery operated and not plug in? With all the animals we have and all the natural debris of nature trying to infiltrate our home on a constant basis I have quickly come to highly appreciate this device. The collection bin is a little on the small side and can be a bit messy to empty when filled with super fine materials, but I just empty it outside to deal with this, a very minor issue to me. There is an easy to use lever that pushed out all filth with flick of your finger. Spectacular product and I highly recommend it.

 The mop attachment is nice. Though not as impressive it does the job. It does work quite well; I just don’t see a jump in effectiveness that I get from the main vacuum. Fill the reservoir in the mop head attachment with water, slap on the pads and you are pretty much ready to go. Very easy setup and maintenance. In our pet room and bathroom we also spray a little cleaner on the floor first. The mop isn’t too heavy and is surprisingly effective at getting into corners. We can almost get all the area behind the toilet and the wall with it. Like the rest of the device the mop head feels extremely well built. But at the end of the day this is just 2 terry cloth pads circling around. Floors that are dirtier will just kind of spread some of the dirt around and not pick it all up. There is no suction involved with the mop at all. So well it does excellent cleaning the bathroom floors, the floor by the doors just seem better to use our previous mop. You can vacuum the floor first before you mop, that does help and I would recommend doing that if you can actually see any dirt or dust first.

 Over all I gave these review 5 stars, I was going back and forth between 4 and 5. The vacuum is 5* plus...It’s spectacular and I would 100% recommend this to anyone who is looking for a cordless vacuum in this price range. The mop is ok. I think someone living in a home with less nature surrounding you and less little cat and dog paw action tracking in stuff would actually like it more. Like I mentioned earlier it does seem to work fairly well in the areas where there is much less dirt tracked. You can get the vacuum without the mop attachment. So all in all I’m about 50/50 on if I would recommend that part of the package to a friend. Great job though LG in designing and building something that feel solid is an age where things feel like they are getting more cheaply built."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,1/14/2022 20:06,SamK,LG stick vacuum,Great product! We use the vacuum and mop attachment on our LVP floors and it works great! Battery lasts long than I expected too!
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,5/4/2021 16:22,Derek,An excellent upgrade with great features,"A little over a year ago, I picked up my first A9 and left a very happy review for it. When a newer version came out this year with wet/dry capability, I jumped at the chance to review it. As a member of the Best Buy Technical Insider Network, I received the A9 in exchange for an unbiased and truthful review. I love my old A9, and after extensive use over the last year, it is still in service in my household. Having a cordless vacuum with so much power is a benefit in a large house and saves me from having to plug and unplug the unit every time I move from a room to another.

I received the new A9 last week, and I've had an opportunity to use it quite a bit since then. The A9 Wet/Dry comes with a varied set of attachments. Mine had a roller attachment for carpet, the typical edge and upholstery attachments, and something new this year, a wet/dry mop attachment for cleaning hard floors. Something new in this year's model is also what LG is calling Kompressor technology, a small ring that can be pressed down to help with cleaning the canister. In prior year models, the A9 was a pain in the rear to clean. It required reaching up into the canister with fingers or a brush to try to grab hair and other debris collected in there. Fortunately, LG fixed this issue this year with the Kompressor lever, making cleaning the canister a breeze. Run time has been increased from 80 to 120 minutes over the prior model. It also sounds quieter to me. Filtration is easy to remove and clean.

I only have a few rugs and a lot of wood flooring, so I would have been better suited for a unit that had the hard floor attachment, but the carpet attachment worked just fine for my wood floors. It was a little more noisy cleaning hard floors than if I had a hard floor attachment, but it still worked really, really well. It was easy to vacuum my 2400 square foot home on one battery. The wet/dry mop function is easy to use. The A9 comes with two sets of pads that are mounted on the head. You can either fill the head with water or perform a dry mop with them. I preferred the wet mop function. The A9 slowly feeds water through the two rotating pads and you mop your floors allowing the A9 to do all the work. I generally use a Swifter to mop my wood floors, but no longer. The A9 is just too easy to use. After mopping, just rinse the pads off and let them dry. I'll throw them in the washer with towels and wash them together. The process has been made so easy.

LG had a winner in my book with the A9 last year. This year they improved on the old unit and added a wet mop function. There are all kinds of attachments that can be bought for the A9, depending on what you want to do with it. There is also a wifi function where you can sync the A9 with your phone app and it'll pass on messages. To be honest, I wasn't interested in this aspect of the unit and did not connect it to my network.

I highly recommend this unit to anyone looking for a cordless all-in-one vacuum/mop."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,12/4/2021 5:03,NickinJackson,Great stick vac,"A great little pick up device. We have nearly all hardwood floors and don’t need or use a larger vacuum clearer often.  This is better for our purpose. Very quick to pick up off of the stand and resolve little messes.   Enough battery to outlast the job.  Pickup is good.   I’d give it 5 stars for every thing except it doesn’t have the kind of suction of air flow need for the biggest of job.  Still, it does exactly what I need it to.  I have a shop vac for wet vacuuming and the biggest messes so this is a great little device.   In second thought, I’m moving it to 5 stars."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,4,5/12/2021 8:02,Bluevue,Premium level stick vac with a couple draw backs,"First off this is a very high end vacuum. The suction is amazing! It has 3 levels - normal, high, and turbo.(wow) Run times are 60 min, 12min, and 7 min respectively. I use it on normal mostly and sometimes boost it to high but will hardly need the turbo. The filters couldn't be easier to change and they include 2 so you can wash one and use one. The cyclone part is even easily removable and washable! Finally a company getting some things right. The bin is simple to empty, just push a button. Use the ""kompressor"" to help empty the bin so you don't have to reach inside. Don't use the ""Kompressor"" while it's running or it will get stuck.
I was floored that it comes with 2 batteries! And they can both be charged at the same time in the stand. Now the stand. I have been waiting for a company to come up with exactly this! I have had 3 other stick vacs and no decent place to store them. This stand looks premium, stores the vac and accessories, and keeps the vac charged and ready to go. The whole package looks so attractive,(love the wine color) I have no problem keeping it tucked in my living room. 
The vac comes with 2 power heads. A combo for hard floors/carpet and a mop head. The power head works great on carpet but so so on hardwood. I was really hoping for a way to slow the brush roll or turn it off but nope, not an option. Only full speed. (firmware update LG) it has a tendency to scatter deris this way. Also there is no light on it! Being able to see in dimmer spots is actually a good thing. 
I was really excited about the mop head but that is a major let down. There is no pick up of water, no vacuum function. It only spins and drips the water/cleaning solution around. You are the ""vacuum"" , taking off the pads often to rinse the dirt out. It comes with 4 which helps. The pads do do a decent job of removing dirt and spills tho, just keep rinsing.
This stick vac is lightweight and feels really good to hang onto. The adjustable height stick is a nice plus. There is an app (it even has wifi) if you need to check usage times and battery level.? Ok. 
All in all its a great, premium level vac. Phenomenal suction and run times!"
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,4,9/11/2021 14:32,CMcK,"good vacuum, bad mop","purchased as a replacement for a conventional vacuum and had high hopes for the mop attachment. This has good suction, and suction is improved when using the turbo mode. Motor is quite loud. The mop attachment is not very useful. The difference in water output from from the two options is not noticeable and does not do a very good job of cleaning the floors. If looking for a combo vac/mop, don't, just buy this for the vacuum function and buy a separate mop/steamer."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,11/1/2021 19:27,Susana,Love love love,"I love it so much! Super easy to use, such a great add on with the mop. Battery life is great but the bin capacity is a little small"
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,5/12/2021 21:26,BBReviewer,A life changing appliance,"This LG - CordZero A9 Wet/Dry Cord-Free Stick Vacuum is a life changer!! Seriously! With every option I tried, I liked this vacuum more and more. I have been a D***n user - so I am no stranger to cordless stick vacuuming. This LG can really vacuum. The suction is fantastic. There are 3 suction levels - normal, power and turbo. I found the normal setting to be adequate and it really sucked up a lot of dirt as evidenced by the debris in the dust bin (which is so easy to empty).

This LG vacuum with its power mop nozzle turns this appliance into a hard floor cleaner. Just remove the vacuum nozzle and put on the mop nozzle. It automatically knows which nozzle is attached and in this mode it knows not to suck. Put on the supplied mop pads, fill the tank with water and you’re now ready for hard floor cleaning. I have hard wood floors which don’t like water, so I set the water adjustment button to STOP (I didn’t put any water in the tank. This way, no water was dispensed onto the floor). I squirted the hardwood floor cleaner directly on the floor and just guided the LG Cord Zero over it to clean my floor! When done, I hand washed and dried the pads and I was ready for the next time. So easy and quick! I felt like a professional. 

The charging stand is a dream. It can be, but doesn’t necessarily need to be, attached to a wall. The base is heavy enough to keep everything in place and I mean everything! 2 batteries (1 charges while attached to the unit in the stand and 1 charges in the charging stand itself). Yes, 2 batteries!! Also holds the attachments - the crevice tool and the combination tool; the mop nozzle and the mop pads. The cord stores neatly in the back of the stand. Everything is compact and in one convenient, easy to find place.
The LG ThinQ app makes life even easier. Just download from the Apple store or Google Play store and install then follow the directions for connecting it to your WiFi . With this, you can easily look up the cleaning history - when was it used, in what mode and for how long. If the filters need cleaning the app will let you know. When the battery was recharged, I received a notification on my iPhone! If something seems wrong, run the Smart Diagnostics for assistance.

This is an absolutely amazing appliance. There is so much more to it than I have written (and I know, I wrote a lot!). I am so very glad I have it and I would not hesitate to highly recommend thIs LG - CordZero A9 Wet/Dry Cord-Free Stick Vacuum to anyone."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,7/30/2021 22:39,PRGuru,Cordless and Easy to Use,"The new version of the LG cordless vacuum  with the power mop is amazing and a game changer. While it is expensive, it's worth it. I did purchase mine on sale."

bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,12/24/2021 16:20,Kiska,Wonderful,Best vacuum I’ve ever had. Love the power and battery life.
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,5/5/2021 5:42,DHCrocks,enough power to do a whole house,"What really stands out about this cordless vacuum is that it comes with removable batteries and it comes with 2! That is so awesome, you will never have to worry about not having enough juice. The charging stand will charge the battery in the vacuum and the extra one at the same time which is really nice. Very easy and intuitive to use. The accessories fit together super easy. The extension tube can be extended to 3 different positions which makes it comfortable to use. The trash bin is on the small side but is the most easy to empty that I have come across, it has a wiper that cleans the inside of the bin so you don't have to stick your hands in there or take it apart to clean it out. The brush head works on both carpet and hard floors and is easy to maneuver. 

A unique attachment is the mop head, I recommend first vacuuming with the brush to pick up all the dirt and then use the wet mop head to give your hard floors a good cleaning. It glides across the floor effortlessly and will give you a nicely cleaned surface but don't expect it to get out stuck on stains, you will still need to get on your hands and knees to scrub them well as it is not an abrasive cleaner. It will get all remaining light dust and dirt that the vacuum misses. 

I like it, my new favorite vacuum. Since its cordless, you can take it anywhere and with the two batteries you don't have to worry about dead batteries anymore."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,2,11/10/2021 16:41,mastershai,"Good luck, hopefully I got the only lemon","I have owned a Dyson Cordless Vacuum for the last 9 years with zero problems at all. Decided to go with LG's cordless, because it was lighter and had more features. First impressions were great. We loved it, the vacuum was quiter and just as powerful as a dyson. The wet mop feature was nice for our wood floors. But 8 weeks later the brush motor stopped working. I made sure nothing was jammed in there. I returned it back to bestbuy, had to use my geek squad warranty. Glad I had it but, why pay $120 for warranty and need to use it with in 2 months. Bestbuy should have refunded the whole purchase including the cost of the warranty."

bestbuy,LG A929KVM,4,6/12/2021 1:35,Chrizfm,Vacuum mop,Overall great vacuum. Power isn’t as strong as it’s main competitor but it does what it needs to do. The mop is good for maintenance. Don’t expect a full out mop. So it might not be the best for super dirt floors. I use in during week for maintenance and then use a full mop weekends. Satisfied.
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,5/22/2021 18:41,VADarkstar,Keeping Up With Stiff Competition,"Cordless stick vacuums are all the rage these days and they can be very impressive. But many models continue to have problems with battery longevity and failure - so it is difficult to assess the expected lifespan of the heartbeat of any cordless vacuum. 

And while every vacuum manufacturer seems to be rushing a cordless stick vacuum to market, there are only a few of them that are playing at the top of their game: Tineco, Dyson, Samsung, and LG. All of them look and perform about the same (mostly just variations on the original Dyson design). For me, it is difficult to differentiate between their releases based on ergonomics or functionality.

Note: Miele makes a well-received vacuum in this category that is not so identical in design, but I find that its lower center of gravity makes it clunky to maneuver.

But this new model from LG has a few solid improvements that, for me, make it recommendable in a very competitive field. 

(1) It comes with TWO batteries, not one. They advertise this fact claiming ""two rechargeable batteries that deliver up to 120 minutes* of uninterrupted cleaning."" And the ""*"" represents the caveats of usage at the lowest possible setting (and, of course, spread across two separate batteries at full charge). But, caveats aside, the batteries here are amazing. I have a three bedroom house and can now vacuum my entire house at the highest suction setting and with the beater bar running on a single battery. Outstanding!

(2) One of the included attachments here is the terribly named ""Power Mop Nozzle"" - even the image on the box is unimpressive. But it's actually amazing. It is a replacement head for the primary vacuuming attachment that buffs hard floors (using water, not cleaning fluids) - and the mopping head is noticeably heavier than the vacuuming head which you would need to insure the buffing heads have sufficient contact with the floor. This kit comes with two sets of washable buffers. It felt very strange and counterintuitive to mop my floors with a vacuum cleaner but this system works beautifully. 

(3) Kompressor™ technology - a term I do not like that describes an action that I love. The debris receiving reservoir is quite small on this vacuum (as it is on all cordless stick vacuums) - and even some light vacuuming can collect debris in a way that reduces capacity. Kompressor™ technology is, quite simply, a manual way to compress/kompress the collected debris to the bottom of the collection chamber to support less-frequent emptyings. As a dog owner whose house is constantly littered with hair, this single simple manual packing tool is amazing.

(4) I know this is a goofy detail, but there is NO assumption here that you want to install any part of this system on a wall! Every part fits on a very compact and well-designed stand. The battery in the vacuum charges and the spare battery charges separately so you can always depend on both batteries being at full charge and at your disposal. There is even room on the back of the stand for the spare buffing wheels for the power mop. 

(5) The final detail that is amazing for me is the telescoping wand (the ""stick"" part of this stick vacuum). Basically, the part that runs between the motor and the end of the vacuum can be extended by about a foot. LG rightly advertises it as a feature to help you with those hard-to-reach places - but as a tall person, I found it incredibly helpful to be able to simply adjust the vacuum so I didn't have to stoop down while I was cleaning house. 

This vacuum is doing everything it can to stand out in a very competitive field. 

VERY highly recommended!"
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,3,8/21/2021 1:45,Great,Great vac but,"Its been great so far. But its only been a few weeks.  Ive owned a Dyson stick vac and that was great too except.... the attachments would eventually become loose over time. Which i didn't appreciate very much.  Spending so much on a stick vacuum and after a period of time feels like a piece of junk. Because you figure once you clip the wand on to the vacuum and then the attachment onto the wand. And if both are sloppy, just feels like a piece of junk. 
So.... ""so far"" LG has done a good job with that part. Canister is on the small side. And hole into vac isn't huge, so little larger debris get stuck. Love the docking stand. The mopping heads might be just a selling feature. It/they dont work the greatest. Other than that.... umm, its a good vac. Again for this vac also, the prices are just stupid crazy high."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,4/30/2022 6:28,TTTT,Overall Happy with LG Cordless,lighter than competitor brand and suction is powerful. bit of downside is the battery time if you put in on turbo mode - drains quickly.
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,4,12/10/2021 19:19,Guest0123,Cleaning made better,"Love this vaccum, dont regret spending so much on this product. The only reason i wont put 5 stars is due to the fact that it doesnt pick up larger pieces which is no real issue for me."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,7/10/2021 2:07,Skipper,Great vacuum cleaner,This is a nice vacuum. The battery life is excellent. The wet vacuum function works well as well as the dry mode. I also love the build quality of the vacuum cleaner. The weight is good so that your hands and arms do not get tired. Assembly did not take too long with the given instructions.
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,4,5/15/2021 23:17,NBCTeach05,"Great product, but requires a lot of effort","As a long-time reviewer of many products for Best Buy, I have read tons of owner’s manuals, assembled many appliances, and figured out how to use new products before most people even knew they existed. Over time, I have learned to appreciate colored graphics with easy step-by-step directions in large print. This was a product that required the most effort on my part to read the manual and get it up and working. The nine pages of warnings and caution statement made me question if I knew what I was getting into. I actually had to search for a video on assembling the charging station because the number of part names and the smaller, less clear black & white drawings did not inspire confidence that I was putting things together correctly. 

Despite those challenges, here are the aspects I have fallen in love with:

• The charging station is such an asset. It can go almost anywhere and even be hidden from view yet still conveniently located. You know you places the product on the charging station correctly when you get the audible sound. 
• The accessories make any clean-up job a breeze, from cleaning the floor to your car, to curtains and furniture with the combo tool and the crevice too. 
• The ability to store the nozzles and the cleaning tools in the charging station and nozzle storage cradle means these items don’t get dirty on the floor of the hall closet or lost under other stuff in the closet. They also are easy to remove when putting them to use.
• Adjusting the extension pipe is great for a taller person and it means there isn’t another longer piece of pipe to add on or keep track of. 
• Being able to adjust the suction power of the vacuum let’s you pick up bigger messes or go faster to clean. I primarily use the turbo mode even though that uses up more battery power. 
• The power of the vacuum is incredible! It even picks up pet hair really well from carpets. This is the cleanest I have ever seen my rugs and floor!
• Most of my floors are hardwood, so being able to use low mode for just a small amount of water being released was great. 
• I haven’t yet tried cleaning the dust bin or the filters, but I like that I can clean the filters with water and it comes with a cleaning brush to clean the cyclonic mesh filter. 
• The two batteries translate to a long battery run time which is perfect if you want to clean the entire house in one session and not have to recharge it every 5-10 minutes. 
• While I have used the Kompressor lever to squish down the pet hair/dust/lint, etc., I find that dumping it out of the dust bin is super easy. 
• No cord means no plugging it in, detangling yourself or the vacuum. It also means you can take it everywhere (inside and outside) and not have to worry about finding an electrical outlet. 
• It is fairly light weight yet solid enough that the nozzle isn’t bouncing all over the floor. 
• There is a nice hard plastic maintenance guide with the main information you need to run, clean and troubleshoot the wet/dry vacuum/mop. As a bonus, there is a suction cup for easy mounting in a spot you can locate it quickly when you need it. 

The aspects that are helpful but require more effort:

• The display on the handle indicates clogged items, filter cleaning alerts, connection status, Wi-Fi indicator, and battery charge. Four out of five of these display indicators require more in-depth reading of the owner’s manual to decipher and resolve. 
• It was nice to not have to purchase specific detergents to use the mop, but I question how effective it is to clean with just warm water. 
• The ThinkQ application didn’t resonate with me so I didn’t connect it. I am sure it would be helpful to see the cleaning history (frequency, time and mode) but it didn’t seem as beneficial to me at this time to warrant setting it up. It does indicate the filter cleaning cycle alarm, smart diagnosis and filter cleaning guide, but at this time it is a bit overwhelming. 
• The product has many parts that can be cleaned by hand. That does mean a lot of attention to put in over time so the product stays in good working order. 

The downside:

• I had a tough time figuring out which side of the mop pads had the lines. It was even harder to see once I moistened the mop pads. 
• The mop pads and water tank should be dried completely before storing them. The mop pads took about 2 days to dry completely and the water tank about 1 day. 

I do recommend this product to people. This has been the best vacuum I have ever had. However, I feel compelled to say I would not recommend this for someone who would not take the time to carefully read the owner’s manual in order to be cognizant of, and willing to follow, the multiple step instruction and cautions. This is not a product that gets unboxed and requires little care. The price tag alone will make people stop and think that this is a serious investment of money. The safety and operating instructions are at a higher level than a regular vacuum and mop and would be best in the hands of someone willing to put in the time and effort to understand how to best care for this CordZero A9 Wet/Dry Cord-Free stick vacuum so they can get the best performance out of it for the life of the product. And with the proper care, that can be a long time."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,7/26/2021 20:59,Michael,Great vacuum with best-in-class stand,"Excellent suction, good battery life, outstanding stand.  Battery lasts surprisingly long, even on turbo mode.  Included second battery is really convenient.  The stand holds all the included accessories, charges the vacuum, and the backup battery.  Highly recommend."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,2,4/8/2022 17:15,Travis,High hopes but disappointing.,"I had high hopes for this vacuum. It did not live up to them. Pros - it comes with an extra battery which is pretty helpful. Also unlike the Dyson you don’t have to continue pressing the trigger and order for the vacuum to continue working.
Cons - it constantly clogs. Even after cleaning it out and checking for any clogging it still indicates it’s clogged. The housing that attaches the canister to the main shaft does not detach from the canister housing this makes to remove clogs from that area.
It is not a wet vac or a mop vac. The mopping function simply dispensers water and spend some microfiber cloths on the floor. It does not suck up anything. In summary we can only use this vacuum for about five minutes before it indicates it has a clog and it is extremely hard to remedy after that has happened. Unfortunately I would not recommend this vacuum."

bestbuy,LG A929KVM,4,5/20/2021 11:09,NJRY,Lightweight vacuum with nice extras,"LG's foray into stick vac territory is a success with the CordZero wet/dry stick vacuum. Feature-rich and simple to use, this device takes on both carpeted and hard floors with ease, and without the use of any buckets or chemical treatments. CordZero is a great do-it-all option to get your home clean quickly. 

The CordZero comes completely disassembled, and while the instructions aren't the greatest read, everything pieces together in a simple, logical manner. The cord vac has a beautiful burgundy/wine color that's not an eyesore, so that's a plus. The charging stand holds all the accessories (even the included extra mopheads!), and it is small and portable which allows for numerous storage options. I especially love the double battery: one battery is in the vacuum and charges in the stand, while the other charges up in the stand itself and is ready to go. Each battery gives you up to 60 minutes continuous runtime, which gives you plenty of time to get your entire house done. 

LG's vacuum is lightweight with an adjustable stick tube. The stick vac stores small but when in use, you may extend the tube to a much longer, full length. There are two power settings, Normal and Turbo, and I found the normal setting to be perfectly capable for hardwood floor vacuuming. Turbo seemed to be needed more for carpeted rooms, but I have some furry pets with rooms that need an unusual amount of vacuuming. One of the nice features is the ""Kompressor"" technology, which allows you to push the collected dirt down inside the collection tank, allowing you to continue cleaning instead of constantly heading to a garbage can to empty the tank. This compressing action did allow some dirt to get trapped in the upper area of the tank, which required some extra work to remove, but overall it is a nice feature. 

The vacuum has good range of motion for twisting to hard to reach areas. I did find some ""sticking"" issues while turning corners with the vacuum on carpeting, having to labor a bit to get the vacuum to properly change directions. I'm hopeful that over time this becomes a non-issue. The mop function is a nice add-on, especially since it just uses water. Simply fill the removable water tank and go, no fuss. Removal and cleaning of the mopheads is also a simple task. 

Lastly, the CordZero has smart-home capabilities, connecting to your home Wi-Fi and allowing you to track your cleaning history or run system diagnostics from the free LG app. I didn't find this function to be necessary, but it is definitely a nice bonus if you're on the fence about this feature-rich product. 

LG's CordZero is a solid vacuum option for all household environments. From carpeted to wood-flooring and tile, this stick vac can adapt to your cleaning needs. Despite some small issues, the CordZero's feature-rich catalog makes it a worthwhile addition to your home. 

Full disclosure, I received this product for my honest, unbiased review."

bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,5/10/2021 12:24,AZEqualizer,Impressive Stick Vacuum with mop action,"LG CordZero A9 Wet/Dry Cord-Free Stick Vacuum with Kompressor Technology.

This is a very nice stick vacuum. It is light and easy to use. It comes with 2 batteries. The run time is approximately 8 to 34 minutes dependent on the vacuum mode and if using a powered attachment. It is light at under 4 lbs. and has good balance. It can be used like a full-size vacuum, a small handheld unit or as a power mop. It has a pleasant design. It's mostly made of plastic with a metal wand and rubber grips so it should be treated nicely. It comes with a sturdy stand that can be free-standing or hooked to your wall and is handy to store the vac, charge it and store the tools.. It is easy to assemble. Several parts need maintenance, but each part is easy to access – most maintenance it just cleaning.

The units vacuum works in Normal mode, Power mode and Turbo mode for those difficult cleaning areas. The Powerhead is a powered rotating brush that picks up hair while not clogging the brush. The Powerhead works well on both carpet and bare floors. The Wet mop accessory works surprisingly well and the reservoir pumps an appropriate amount of water ( don’t use detergent or solvents) to the head ( Velcro attached pads.)

I found the vacuum to be extremely quiet in all modes other than Turbo – but you have to expect some noise if you kick it into turbo mode so I wasn’t surprised. The mop head is also very quire. It is quite versatile and sees action for quick jobs, getting into hard places, and of course, cleaning out one's vehicles. 

The app from LG is a little behind the times requiring 2.4ghz band and doesn’t even understand WiFi 6 and the ability to select the correct signal and frequency to use. So no I didn’t load the app. which looking at it seems more of a gimmick to me anyway."

bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,5/28/2021 19:14,Tulip,Super Sweeper,"Love the vacuum!  Lightweight, easy to assemble, like the removable attachment."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,5/6/2021 20:40,FlyingC,Well-thought-out design,"I have a lot of cats and a lot of vacuums that I use to battle the hair and tracked litter. I think this stick vacuum will become the most used in the arsenal for several reasons. First, it's the quietest of all my vacuums on the normal setting. I've found that about 99% of the time that's plenty of suction, though you can bump it up to turbo to get more suction when you need it (and then the accompanying high noise level). Most of the time I'm using it, though, it's very quiet. That makes my ears happy, and makes the cats happy.

Second, the run time on the two batteries. At the normal setting, I can hit all the main traffic areas in my 2500 sqft house on the first battery. But if I need it, the second battery is sitting in the charger always ready to go. The last big reason it'll be the go-to vacuum is the Kompressor feature that lets you keep vacuuming without having to stop and empty it so often.

Though Kompressor sounds maybe slightly evil or something, it's really a simple, effective addition to the usual dustbin in a handheld cordless. It's a lever you push that slides a ring down the inside of the bin to pack all the debris to the bottom and keep the filter area free. With all the cat hair I'm picking up, it's usually fluffy like cotton candy and quickly fills up the other vacuum dustbins. With this LG, though, I can press the cat hair down multiple times and just keep on vacuuming. It also helps to push out everything when you do finally stop to empty it. I think it's a great design.

Now for a couple of things I'm not crazy about, but others may think they're more useful. One is the WiFi connection and the app. I could see if you had other LG products it might make sense to add it to your home devices. But for me as the only LG device I have, I don't get much out of it. Basically, it sends me a push notification when the battery is fully charge. It's not like I'm waiting for that to happen, so I really don't care about it. I think it also has some documentation and troubleshooting help in the app, but I'm really not sure it's worth having it connected to my home Wifi. 

Another thing is the wet mop head. It's really a slick design with the way they've incorporated the water tank in the head. But the mop is essentially two terry cloth pads that buff your floor. I tested it on a tile area where our cats track in a little mud from outside. Normally, I'd spray some cleaner on the area and use 3 or 4 paper towels to clean it up. The wet mop head did pick it up, but it also sort of smeared it around. I took the pads off, washed them out, and went over the area again and it got better. But by the time I did that, I was wondering why I didn't just do the paper towels and be done with it. I have another wet vacuum that dispenses cleaning solution, has actual scrub brushes, and vacuums up the dirty water which I think is a much better option for me. But, depending on your use, you might like it better than me.

The only other feature I wish it had was the ability to turn off the roller brush when you're on hard floors. It works fantastic on carpet and rugs, but it does tend to fling litter or bits of food around on hard surfaces. Other vacuums let you turn off the roller and just use suction, so I'm not sure why they chose not to do that.

At any rate, I'm loving the design of this vacuum. The charging stand is sturdy and works great to hold every tool and attachment that came with it (which is not always the case with others). The battery run time and ease of use make this a top-notch cordless vacuum in my book."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,3,2/20/2021 1:38,JustOk,just ok,"I'm disappointed I thought the suction would be much stronger than what it is. Do like the dual battery system. Overall is just ok, and overpriced."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,5/24/2021 5:04,Zeppelin33,Exactly what I needed,"First thought while opening this box was “Wow, there’s a lot of pieces to this puzzle” 

In reality though, it only took about 5 minutes to put it all together. I lost another 5 minutes by not sliding the pad holder down the charging station tube before putting the charging station on top. Reading the instructions first would have avoided that error. LOL

This thing is a work of art just sitting there. So neat and tidy. So much to it but it barely takes more space than a standard old school vacuum if it even does. The grab and go ability of this is really awesome!! No need to mount to a wall, the stand is very sturdy and useful. Looks perfect sitting in the corner of my kitchen.

It's great not having to hold a trigger the whole time vacuuming. Very comfortable to use.

Having 2 batteries is very nice. And having them both able to be charging at the same time is such a great addition.
My biggest test with any vacuum is cat litter. While it doesn’t sound as powerful as other vacuums, it does the job very well. Power mode seemed to work the best as Turbo mode really drains the battery quickly.

The Kompressor feature really comes in handy when you don’t want to dump the canister and you’re almost done. That was a great idea.

Love the telescoping wand. Sure beats having to add and remove extensions. Just push the button and slide. 

The wi-fi feature is pretty cool. You can look right on your phone to see if it’s fully charged and track usage.

The hardwood floor cleaning pads work well, but they just don’t seem to spin fast enough. Definitely takes longer to clean the floor than using a standard mop. It does work as I can see stains slowly disappear while going back and forth over it but I’m not sure I’ll be using that too much.

Overall, it’s a very nice vacuum and does all you need. The attachments all work well with it.

Very pleased with this"
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,1,12/17/2021 16:07,Brian,Not worth the price.,"Purchased this hoping to replace my Dyson vacuum and Bissell Spin Wave mop. I was let down. The mopping capabilities were slow and ineffective. The vacuum lacked power and didn’t live up to the price point. Returned this item to the store the next day. I normally love LG appliance products but this isn’t on the same level. On a positive note, 5 stars for Bestbuy’s return policy."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,5/23/2021 19:02,Lovetech0507,Vacuum/mop,"I was very excited to use this vacuum, you get 2 for 1, vacuum and mop. First thing I love about this vacuum is the convenience and easy storage. Vacuum is lightweight so easy to carry around the house. I love that it has a stand for easy storage and charging. Some other brands their stick vacuums you have to prop up against something for them to stay after use. Being able to easily go from vacuum to mop with the included attachments is an amazing addition. I have carpet and tile floors and having this vac/mop makes my cleaning so much easier. I absolutely hate having to switch from a vacuum to a traditional mop, it makes the time spent cleaning longer. This vacuum has good suction, I like that it has the dirt compressor which helps you finish your vacuuming without having to empty the container as often with other brands. So simple to put together and use. My family enjoys using this vac/mop so much my teenage kids don’t complain about helping clean, they actually offer to help just to use it. This has been a great addition to my cleaning tools. I definitely recommend this for any household."
bestbuy,LG A929KVM,5,5/21/2021 10:46,beefrob,A truly nice vacuum/mop combo unit,"The LG cord zero wet/dry vacuum may look a little odd with the large canister, but inside that canister is a very powerful motor and a large storage area for all of the stuff this vacuum pulls in. The vacuum has 2 speeds and connects to your wireless internet if you want to use that feature with the LG app. When you first open the box, you could be overwhelmed by all of the parts that are neatly packed in it. But, take your time and lay them out on the table and you will quickly see that everything easily snaps together, including the charging stand. I intentionally put the whole vacuum and stand together without the instructions to see how easy it was, and I didn't have any problems at all. The unit comes with 2 batteries that together should offer nearly 2 full hours of use. The LG also comes with the mop attachment and 2 sets of mops. I know its hard to get excited about a vacuum, but the LG A9 wet/dry vacuum really is something special. With the included stand, you are able to charge both batteries at the same time and store all of the included attachment together in a fairly small footprint. I have mine sitting behind a bathroom door. This is a unit that can replace your corded vacuum and your wet mop. It has a very long run time with the 2 included batteries and has enough power for any normal vacuuming job. What more could anyone want? I like mine."

bestbuy,LG A929KVM,4,5/10/2021 15:15,neio11,It makes cleaning convenient,"LG - CordZero A9

I have the previous generation CordZero and emptying the canister is gross. Doesn’t take much to fill it either. With the Kompressor Technology, clearing the canister is a lot less gross. During cleaning, the Kompressor Technology compacts the dirt in the canister so it can take on more dirt and debris. This is a much needed added feature.

This CordZero A9 has interchangeable accessories with the previous CordZero including the charging stand. The accessories has not changed. This new A9 makes a chime noise when installed on the charger. Weighs a bit more but hardly noticeable. It has the same 84db noise rating as the previous and it only bothers me when I am cleaning above me when it is closer to my ears.

It comes with two rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that can be simultaneously charged in 3.5 hours in the docking station giving you up to 120 minutes of runtime compared to the 80 minutes from the previous model. It’s still giving too short of a time when using the power nozzle on turbo mode. Just about 6 minutes of runtime so just a little 12 minutes with both batteries then you would have to wait about three and a half hours to continue cleaning. 

The upgraded inverter motor is up to 200AW (Air Watts) compared to 140AW from the previous model and you can tell the difference. I like using this with the telescoping wand and the crevice or the combo tool and just walk around the house picking up hair and debris and now with this model, I can go around the house cleaning grime with the mop nozzle. The mop nozzle comes with two sets of microfiber pads which does a descent job of scrubbing off simple grime from the hard floors but don’t expect it scrub off hard stuck on grime like hardened syrup. You’ll be there all day scrubbing that. LG recommends not to use detergent or any liquid other than water in the tank for some reason so this is not to replace your spring cleaning mop but just touch up mopping. I put my mop solution in a spray bottle and sprayed as needed along the way. There’s no button to spray water manually but it has a button on the mop nozzle for adjusting how much water gets dripped on to the mop pads. It has four LED headlights for mopping at night?…. or dark areas. It’s pretty quiet so I guess you can mop at night. You cannot change the rotation speed of the mop so it doesn’t use much battery. I got tired of mopping before one battery bar was used and LG doesn’t recommend using the mop for more than 80 minutes straight.

It has a five stage HEPA filtration system that cleans the air coming from vacuum and according to LG, it filters out 99.99%* of dust and dirt. All the filters are washable including the cyclone system. Make sure you clean them often to ensure good suction.

I like the docking station. It charges both batteries at the same time, it has storage for the unit and its tools and you have multiple ways to install it. You can mount it on the wall, self-standing or have it lay on the floor. It’s stores everything neatly and doesn’t take up much room. The only thing bad about it is that if you are not using the wand and the floor nozzle, there is nowhere to store them together on the docking station. You can barely squeeze the wand unto the tool storage. Also, keep in mind that this unit does not stand up by itself so when you need to pause your cleaning, you have to bend down and lay it down on the floor. I wouldn’t stand it up against wall because I don’t think this can withstand a hard fall. It’s made with a whole lot of plastic just like the old model.

Overall, I like this vacuum. As like my old CordZero, I like the convenience factor of this unit most of all. It makes maintenance and everyday cleaning a breeze especially with the added mop nozzle. It’s cordless so just pick it up and get cleaning done!"

The worst thing is emptying the dust collected. It puffs into your face!! I decided to put up with this, but after 4 months, using once a week, it died. It also doesn’t do well picking up anything as big a small piece of dog kibble or cereal.  I noticed they now have one with it’s own dust  bags. I liked the docking station. We don’t have dog hair & i cleaned the filter every time. I’m returning it. If you buy one make sure you get the insurance offered by Amazon. It’s a good thing I bought this from Amazon directly. They’re refunding my purchase price. I’m really disappointed. I wanted 2 batteries & no switch I have to hold down, (like Dyson). Now Dyson has a large one with 2 batteries & you can add a $10  switch to hold the switch on. But I’ll only purchase from Amazon. Make sure Amazon is the SELLER!!"

amazon,LG A927KVMS,5,4-Apr-21,lovetoshop,very nice vacuum,"after my first go around with cordless vacuum cleaners, i was disillusioned mainly because of the battery charge. since i clean houses for a living it was important to look for an efficient cleaner thats both great on suction and battery charge time. when i read that LG offered 2 batteries and said each battery had a max charge time of 1 hour i was impressed. so today i had 2 jobs, one of which was a very large home and my LG performed magnificently and it even made it thru my 2nd job on the same battery! very easy to operate and easy to unclog and clean, i love it. i also like the wifi feature too but just wish it would connect outside of my home wifi. i was also amazed at the amount of dirt that it picked up from both of my jobs which only tells me it has great suction power. and the kompressor is also a very nice feature too that i love. LG did a great job with this cleaner"
amazon,LG A927KVMS,5,24-Oct-21,Coral,"Powerful, versatile, and light weight cordless vacuum","This cordless stick vacuum is well designed and versatile.  Considering the strength of the suction, this unit is very quiet.  It does a great job with pet hair.  Battery life is good, but I am using this vacuum for quick daily cleaning.  The floor brush has a higher profile than a standard vacuum and doesn’t fit under low furniture.  It may not be the only vacuum you need, but the stick is wonderful for most jobs.  I can’t attest to the durability of this cordless stick unit as I have only used it a short time.  It was a great purchase for me."

This vacuum is perfect on them and does not leave any scratches! The only time it did, there was a piece of tape stuck on the bottom of it ??Lastly, no cord! I have never previously owned a cordless vacuum, and it really does make vacuuming way less annoying. Cordless and light, 10/10 would recommend!!"

I really like that it has two batteries. I have three stories and one battery is enough to get the job done. I also like the stand. I wasn’t a huge fan of the wall mount necessary with other brands. The suction and attachments are sufficient. As someone that has other LG appliances, I like that it works with the ThinQ app as well. I honestly don’t have any complaints so far. Just as an FYI, I do not have pets. So I cannot attest to how it performs with pet hair."

amazon,LG A927KVMS,1,"Reviewed in the United States ???? on April 17, 2022",S. K.,"Tiny bin, constant obstruction, died in 10 months NO SUPPORT","Lots of hair in household, both dog & human.  Suction particularly on carpet is incredible.  The downside? You can hardly even complete one area rug without having to empty the bin, even when you compress the dirt down with the bar.  If you go a few second after hitting the full line you have to empty, open it up, remove the dust separator and stick a tool inside to remove the extra hair/dirt manually. It’s a frustrating mess.  After only ten months of owning it, the brush head stopped rolling and it’s useless until LG sends me another one.  The entire thing may have just died.  Just bought an XL + version of competitor for twice the price.  Let’s see how that stacks up. UPDATE: LG ordered me a new brush head spinning nozzle, but the problem is that it’s on back order and they have no idea when it’ll be delivered I called to report a loss of suction from the main unit and they can’t even schedule an appointment for a repair until I receive the roller head to see if it solve the problem. So essentially I’m stuck with a 400 something dollar piece of junk I ordered the Dyson outsize plus dropped 1000 bucks let’s see how that one works because I can’t be without a vacuum."

Dust collector is also hard to open. Battery life was the best out there which was a major purchasing point.

amazon,LG A927KVMS,1,22-Jul-21,Jon and Ashton,Vacuum head broke on First day. Return has been a nightmare,The suction power is mediocre. You have to turn the turbo on all the time for it to really vacuum.Definitely not worth the price as it breaks easy and has minimal suction.The vacuum head attachment broke on the first day. We tried to return it only to find out almost a month later that we need to send the part to a different department even though LG created the return shipping label. LG mailed us back the broken part and said try again.For the money I’d go with a different product.

amazon,LG A927KVMS,2,16-Sep-22,Carly,DO NOT BUY if you have a dog that sheds!,The compression canister is great in theory but horrible in practice. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS IF YOU HAVE A DOG THAT SHEDS. Pet hair gets stuck in the back of the canister between the plastic piece you push down to compress the dirt and the filter and there's no way to access that space besides getting a wire and fishing out the clogged hair. I've had to do this after each use. After only vacuuming 3 rooms. It's super annoying and poorly designed. It would probably work great in a house without pets. I'm really disappointed.

This did much better than my cordless vacuum which I finally gave to my daughter because I don't want another corded vacuum now. Picks up great and easy to clean.

amazon,LG A927KVMS,4,"Reviewed in the United States ???? on September 13, 2020",OmegaMan,"Buy For Push Out Dirt Button Operation/Better Battery Life, but Lament the missing Power Floor Brush","I have owned both models, the lesser A906SM (906) and this model A927KGMS (927). We purchased the 906 at Costco and loved it. But emptying of the `dust bin` usually required the use of the `crevice tool`  (the attachment which one uses to remove dirt from corners) to unwind the `cyclonic mesh filter` (the internal filter behind the plastic in the bin) to fully remove all the hair and what not which became settled at the top of the dust bin. No biggie..but....We liked the 906 until we saw the LG commercial for the 927 and seeing the operation of the red button `Kompressor lever` (LG's bad name given for the dust removal push operation) on TV. My wife and I literally went back to the 906 looking for this system of dust bin debris removal....only to not find it.We then purchased the 927 at Best Buy (the only place locally to have it; and not Costco nor Amazon) and returned the 906 back to Costco. Upon setting it up the 927 I immediately noticed that it didn't have a Power Floor Brush. What? I checked the box, the manual and did not find it. Uggg it does not come with one! Why?The operation of the 927 is noticeably better than the 906 and pulling up items on a carpet and the battery lasts longer. I like both vacuums, the do their job, but the 906 doesn't have the red button dust removal and the 927 does not have the Power Floor brush for hardwood floors.In terms of performance I could say use either vacuum and the 906's lack of dust removal is not necessarily a deal breaker, but the 927's dust removal is a winner.This review gives a 4 because of the missing `Power Floor Brush` for a throw away almost worthless `Power Punch Nozzle` received. Also the ghost attachments which are listed in the manual (""Mattress Tool"", ""Flexible Crevice Tool"", ""Multi Angle Tool"" and ""Flexible Hose Extension""). For the price of the 927 vacuum all those aforementioned tools and the Power Floor Brush for hardwood floors should be included. Other than that, the vacuum works as advertised with no issues."

They will ship it free of charge under warranty IF and WHEN they ever get it back in stock.  It is back-ordered and they have no estimate of when they will receive a new shipment.

What a HUGE disappointment. It has NO vacuuming power even on turbo. The batteries don’t hold a charge long - but what would you do if they did? ..Not vacuum well longer?  Now I’m stuck with THIS until it dies I hope it is soon, and I will buy my own gifts from now on. I estimate the suction is only 25% of the one I wanted. It has a stand to hold all the attachments that won’t work under low suction. I’m guessing the weight savings is the expensive battery material they removed to save unit costs. Whenever you see the words “light weight” and “battery powered” together it is a marketing disaster that YOU lose"

I hate dealing with the cord getting in the way or unplugging. This LG unit eliminates all of that.In addition to the ease of use it does pick up dirt and dog hair. It moves from bare floor over onto rugs and carpet nicely. Knowing there’s another battery available means I don’t feel the need to rush.The only downside is that the debris container is small so, in my doggy daycare house full of dog hair, I need to empty it a couple of times during my vacuuming. While this need was annoying at first it does not make me dislike this vacuum. I no longer hate vacuuming and grab this baby for use every day now. Never thought I’d say that!UPDATE: It just quit!

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,11-Oct-22,Brodyyy,Go CodeZero - it's a lifesaver!,"My friend recommended this LG CodeZero vacuum when I got pregnant, and oh wow, it's such a life saver. (I used to own a corded vacuum cleaner and while it was high quality, it was always challenging to motivate myself to vacuum as often as I wanted, because it was heavy and such a hassle to run the vacuum cleaner!) You don't need to bend down to plug the vacuum and haul the heavy vacuum cleaner with tangling cords anymore. It's so convenient to go cordless. 

The turbo mode of this vacuum is super powerful and it sucks up the debris pretty well even from our carpeted area. Works great on our hardwood floor as well. Batteries die quickly if you do turbo mode though, but they stay reasonably long enough when you just do the regular cleaning mode.  

One thing I'd wish I had considered is the auto-emptying function. It's actually quite burdensome to empty the bin every now and then because all the dust flies around. I wish I had bought the more expensive version that takes care of that. Other than that, I love my vacuum so much! Thank you LG!"

homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,8-Aug-22,amvmom,Pretty good cordless vacuum,My husband bought this for me when our regular vacuum had to be sent for repairs.  It does have good suction and comes with great attachments.  It is pretty light weight and I don't feel like it is horrible to bring it upstairs and downstairs like with my full size vacuum.  I do feel that I have to increase the power whenever I do use it in order for me to feel like it is working but that might be due to the fact that it is pretty quiet so I feel like it isn't working hard enough.  However when I look at the canister after vacuuming on the regular power there is a ton of hair and crumbs so it must be sucking everything up from the rug.  We do have a goldendoodle who tends to shed so it is often minimum every other day and sometimes daily use.  My only complaint is that the emptying of the canister can be tough as the space in the canister is small due to the size of the filter.  I usually have to pull the hair out or reach in and unscrew the filter and then everything falls out.  I wish it was just slightly thinner or smaller filter (my other vacuum has a smaller filter so this is not an issue).  Otherwise I am happy and we do use it a lot now and definitely worth the cost.

Works good with the included attachment but works even better with the soft roller attachment for our vinyl floor (had to purchase separately)."

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,31-Jul-22,Doug 1951,GREAT MACHINE!," We've only actually had the Vacuum a little over two weeks since delivery was delayed by almost two weeks, But our experience thus far with the unit has been nothing short of phenomenal!  My wife's first comments, when I started using it in the breakfast hutch area was, ""Wow, that's a LOT Quieter than Any of our other cordless vacuums,"" which coming from her was quit a compliment. Charging thus far seems to have gone quite well although I've personally not paid a lot of attention to that aspect...yet. Having owned no less than four previous cordless vacuums spanning the past six years, we're definitely looking forward to the experiences this machine has to offer!"

homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,24-Jul-22,Elliot12345,Great product, I love this vacuum. It works really well. The one issue i have is emptying the bin is not the smoothest process
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,19-Jul-22,1forlexus,Great Stick Vacuum, Works as it should. My wife and I love it. Has great suction and versatility. My only regrets is not getting one sooner and buying the upgraded model. If I could do it over again I would get the highest model with all the attachments. If you’re thinking of getting one just pull the trigger and do it. You won’t regret it. Now I have to purchase all the additional accessories. Plus their customer service is stellar.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,19-Jul-22,Only Facts,Better than I imagined, I was looking for a small but powerful handheld vacuum and this is better than I imagined. It fits nicely in the hand and can be used with attachments for your specific needs. The two batteries make it very easy for continuous vacuuming.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,17-Jul-22,DJIS,LG CordZero A9 Vacuum, The vacuum is great for a male to use but its heavy for a small female to use.  It has some heft to it compared to other models.  It work great and has great suction

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,9-Jul-22,Helenr,Move over Dyson, We had a Dyson v8 which got about a minute on high suction so I expected the same. With the LG it was on maximum suction the entire time it took to thoroughly vacuum my SUV and it had power to spare. We’ve only had for less than a month but so far I’m very happy.

homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,25-Jun-22,MrLV,Quick and easy with plenty of run time.," I bought this two weeks ago. the battery life is great. for pet hair it is great, but emptying it with the hair you need a pencil or something thin to get it out. Small canister that catchers the dirt.. I am now waiting for my main head to be replaced because when I go to use it there is dirt at the base when i go to pick it up. Maybe not closing off the tube or something when shutting down. I did my shopping and the LG model over all out performs all other modes for picking up dust, sand, rice, pet hair, etc. While another model might have beat it in one category, the LG won in all others and price!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,22-Jun-22,Nikki55,Love it!, This vacuum is great! It’s quiet and works really well!
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,17-Jun-22,CatHair,Love my LG CordZero!," I have two cats and had nothing but an old dirt devil upright vacuum which died a little while ago. Finally pushed myself to shop for a new vacuum. A neighbor had bought this unit so I took a look at it and al the features and it really looked promising so I went all in. I was so glad I made this decision. While I was concerned the price was a bit out of range of what I thought I'd pay to buy a new vacuum, it was well worth it. My toughest areas are my couches where my cats like to hang out. This vacuum was able to pick up the hair efficiently to my surprise, when I had paid to have them professionally cleaned in the past, this did the job the same if not better. I love the cordless feature and all of the different attachments as well as dual battery charging system. Couldn't be happier with my purchase and I highly recommend it to those willing to pay a little more to get a better performance vacuum."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,15-Jun-22,HomeDepotCustomer,Lighter more powerful and quieter than our previous Dyson. ...,Lighter more powerful and quieter than our previous Dyson.  10 yr warranty to boot.  Goodbye Dyson and your terrible trigger assembly design.

Item is being returned"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,7-Jun-22,Rhonalds,Excellent product, My wife loves the convenience of going cordless! She absolutely loves this product.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,1,26-May-22,JS94901,"power brush broke, nice design otherwise"," Would be a great vacuum if I did not have quality concerns.  The design is attractive and the included stand keeps this stored conveniently.  There is an extra battery (stored in the stand) so I can vacuum my entire apartment.  I like the on/off button, rather than trigger for extended vacuuming sessions.  Would be nice if a smaller power brush was included for upholstery.  The power brush broke after about two months.  I'm currently awaiting a replacement after contacting customer service twice."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,18-May-22,Escrowlaurie,Works great, I purchase this because it was a little less expensive than other brands on the market thinking I’ll just use it until I can afford the one I really wanted. To my surprise this vacuum is wonderful. I’ve had absolutely no problem with it and having the two batteries is great. Nothings worst than when you’re in the mood clean your battery runs out. Having two batteries is wonderful. It also has a very small profile and everything fits just perfect together on the stand. No need to purchase any other vacuum.

homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,30-Apr-22,dstens,Easy to use and handy," Works as expected for our 1650 sf home. The only disappointment was that it didn't come with a hardwood floor attachment, since our home is all hardwood. There was dandy pet attachment that we don't use since we have no pets. I could not find a floor attachment on the LG website and there was no model # for one in the owner's manual. I would think more people would have wood floors that pets."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,21-Apr-22,TonyDee,I love this Vac!, This by far exceeded my expectations. The suction power is awesome while still being lightweight. I love that its so easy to use. It comes with this nifty base/charging station which holds all the attachments neatly in place plus it also includes an extra battery pack with its own charging port/Dock all while keeping its streamlined & organized & minimalized look! Hardly takes any space at all. Its very thoughtfully designed & extremly functional.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,19-Apr-22,BAMST,Easy to use, I am happy with the choice I made with the LG.  I initially saw this product at our son’s house and asked him about the Cord Zero.  I like the fact that you do not have to hold the trigger to keep the sweeper on.  I like the fact that the wand can be made longer.  And I like the fact it comes with a bare floor attachment.  Also 2 batteries is a nice feature.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,18-Apr-22,Robl817,Very powerful," I can not deny how overlooked the LG vacuum is. With so many brands on the market, I did not even know LG made a vacuum. With that being said, this machine has exceeded my expectations and a very smart purchase. Along with the excellent warranty, there have been no regrets."

However, after a few weeks an odd grinding sound started coming from the rotating head. After having it for about two months I contacted customer support and they quickly got a replacement head sent. That head lasted about four months before it started making the sounds. Now the head no longer rotates, so we can not use it for the floor. Searching for a new vacuum now."

If you turn on turbo your lucky fir maybe 10-15 minutes.  I will say the results are impressive on the what it picks up though. I could never spend this much money on a vacuum personally, mine came free when I purchased my washer and dryer.  But now that I have it I’ll dang sure use it."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,22-Mar-22,kohljon,LG's Cordless Stick Vac," Overall an excellent Cordless Stick Vac. Well made and easy to use. This model arrived in excellent packaging (well designed box) with a complete set of attachments. The only design feature that I found lacking was the ease of emptying the dust collection bin. Also the dust bin/container is extremely small for household use of human & pet hair, small particulate such as coffee, and dead insects. Each time I use this vac I must empty it every 2-3 mins, as it fill up very quickly. Upon emptying, the dust/particulate/hair must be removed using a plastic straw as it does not just shaker fall out.  It's hold capacity is about the same as my Robovac with also must be emptied frequently. I wished it had more hold capacity, especially for such an expensive stick vac."

Attachments are perfect. Battery charges quickly and lasts through any cleaning tasks.
The ability to switch between carpet and laminate flooring is effortless."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,13-Mar-22,Ayesha,Recommended for maintenance cleaning,"I would not recommend this product for heavy duty or deep cleaning - it is perfect for light or maintenance cleaning - otherwise the canister and filters become clogged easily, requiring the consumer to spend more time waiting for the parts to dry before being able to use them for carpet or hard floors. The upholstery attachment is a nice touch, reminiscent of the Rainbow Vacuum System (except without the price point). Additionally, the accessories do not all fit on the appliance model."

Easy to change the attachments and although cleaning the reservoir could be a bit messy it’s really no big deal once you get a system.  The two rechargeable batteries give you more than enough juice to do your cleanup.  This LG vacuum works for me."

homedepot,LG A907GMS,1,28-Feb-22,KB54,Worst Vacuum," This is by far the worst vacuum I’ve ever owned. It gets clogged extremely easily, we spend most of our time trying to unclog it with a tool of some sort. Also, on more than one occasion, because the suction is so poor, something got stuck on the bottom and scratched my hardwood floors. For the price of this vacuum, this should NOT be happening."

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,11-Feb-22,BUnderwood,Love this Vacuum," I bought this vacuum about 2-3 weeks ago. And use it all the time. It’s so light, and easy to use. Picks up great on my carpet and flooring."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,10-Feb-22,Fm503,Great product but it’s not perfect," I love the multiple batteries, charging stand, multiple attachment heads and the fact that it cleans very well. However, the dust bin is hard to clean and the batteries do die very fast on stronger settings."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,2,9-Feb-22,Sarrom444,Poor quality for high price,"I bought this 1 year 8 months ago. I would have expected it to last longer for such a high price. 
The motor is making a high pitched screeching sound. I've been using my old vacuum again because it's not pleasant to listen to. 
I must remove the filter every time I empty the canister because the dirt and dust gets stuck. A tool is used for this but shortly after purchase the nothces wore down making the attachment not work and I must use my hand. It is nearly impossible to remove and always dirty. 
The wand gets extended when used and shortened to charge. When vaccuming carpet with any resistance the wand does not stay extended and will suddenly go in. This has pinched my finger which was very painful. 
Lg only guarantees their products for 1 year. After that you're on your own. I am responsible to replace parts or the entire vacuum. That is not financially possible. I would not recommend this vacuum or this manufacturer for their other products. 
The vacuum was great at first. Loved how easy it is to use. Loved the on/off button versus having to squeeze a button while using."

homedepot,LG A907GMS,3,25-Jan-22,nonicknamesavailable,Worked great until the plastic door broke," I purchased this vacuum in November and used it maybe 5 times.  The latch on the canister was not catching and when I pushed it harder the latch, held by thin wires, broke.  It still works but I have to take the closure off to charge it and duck tape to keep it closed.  Other than that, the vacuum works great."

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,24-Jan-22,Krismo,Excellent Buy!!, I bought this cordless LG vacuum 2 months ago and I can't be happier. The battery lasts longer than my previous cordless vacuum and to make it easier for users as it comes with 2 batteries. I'm able to complete my whole house cleaning without having to worry if the battery will last for me to complete my cleaning. I will highly recommend anyone out there looking for a cordless vacuum.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,18-Jan-22,Shooshie39,Beastly vacuum, I bought this product about 10 months ago. Had an issue with the carpet head roller stopped spinning. They sent me a brand new carpet attachment with proof of purchase. Great all around.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,17-Jan-22,Sally2022,Great vaccum but...," I love this vacuum so much that I give it 5 stars, even though its carpet head died after about 3months.  It took slightly more effort than I expected to get a new one shipped to me (free of charge), but, once I talked to someone (initial email chain was dropped), a replacement was sent promptly.  I hope this one will work long-term, as it is the perfect vacuum for me--love the charging stand, great suction, love how it comes apart to be a handheld for small spaces, etc."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,16-Jan-22,Jon52,Well designed!," My wife and I are both retired but, normal vacuums are getting harder to handle for her based on there weight and the cord being a trip hazard.

This is a very well designed product and “we” highly recommend it to others!!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,10-Jan-22,Today 22,Batteries are a plus two as opposed to one, It vacuums so good I didn’t know how much dirt was in my rug. Easy to handle and operate when you need to do a quick cleanup.

homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,6-Jan-22,Rbpdoglover,Almost Perfect," Since our house deals with a lot of dog and cat fur/hair, I vacuum a lot and go through vacuums frequently. I bought the LG CordZero because it fit a number of my requirements - cordless, light weight, easy to clean, etc. For the most part, I'm very pleased. The things that I wish were a little different are the extension hose does not make the unit tall enough for average height people and I find I have to bend over slightly when I'm vacuuming. Also, the ""trigger like"" piece in the handle is awkward and uncomfortable and seems unnecessary. I love the way the unit stores, and really appreciate the stacking batteries."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,6-Jan-22,Elma5660,Light weight and agile, I appreciate the agility and lightness of the vacuum in maneuvering around the house cleaning. Great little vacuum in the every respect.

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,30-Dec-21,Katkrazy,Lightweight and easy to use," My husband replaced the upstairs flooring with laminate and bought the LG A905RM stick vacuum for me for Christmas. I love the fact it is cordless, lightweight, easy to use in either hand and I can reach all the way under my bed to get the cat fur. Using the turbo feature, it picks up the kitty litter without throwing it back out onto my feet. It is also perfect for vacuuming the stairs. After using this a couple of times, I saw the one that empties itself and mops as well. Wish I had gotten that one!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,30-Dec-21,DineshA,Great suction with three different settings, Excellent product easy to use and great suction with various attachments to clean any surface.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,3,29-Dec-21,mendozaMama,Leaves marks on my floor," Bought this a few months ago and I hate that it leaves marks on my laminate floors! Even on the lowest setting it leaves marks, and they are hard to remove. My house is laminate all throughout,  except 3 of the 4 bedrooms have carpet. I also wish the chamber was bigger. It’s hard to get your fingers in there to remove hair when it gets stuck, and I have tiny hands. I don’t know why, but it also had a mildew type smell that emits out while using. After the first use I thought it would go away, but it has not. I vacuum at least once a day. Other than those flaws/complaints it seems to be a ok vacuum."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,25-Dec-21,Gulf,LG vacuum, Easy to store and convenient storage.  Easy to change out attachments and use
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,25-Dec-21,Roywood77,Simply AWESOME!!!, This is sooooo much better than I imagined. Seriously I have thrown away (draged it out to the curb for heavy pickup) my old vacuum. It worked fine but it was not my new LG. My 11 year old son loves it and insist on using it upstairs and on the baseboards. Like I sad Simply AWESOME.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,20-Dec-21,Huddj,Great Design features, Purchased this unit a month ago and very happy with the design features. Really like the ability to run unit without having to hold trigger assembly on while using. Able to turn off or increase power by using thumb instead. This unit is also very quite (70db range) . Easy to clean and attachments are well made. Does a very good job of picking up debris.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,14-Dec-21,Lisa2000,Love it’s simplicity, Bought this three months ago and am very pleased with its power and how light it is. Love the docking station.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,6-Dec-21,bobotibo,Pretty good vacuum," I hae owned a dyson and I have a robo vac but you still always need a more traditional vacuum for spot use.
seems to have good power
short battery life which I think is standard for all of these stick vacuums
I think more could be done with the switches for example I dont like always needing to hold the power up button every time.  something to keep prior settings would be nice.
I had an issue with my hardwood floor attachment after minimal use and they replaced it no q's asked"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,2,29-Oct-21,Marla1,Buyers Regret," I think this vacuum has enough suction and I like the maneuverability of the floor nozzles. But, several problems make me regret this purchase. I'm not sure if this is a design flaw or if my vacuum is defective, but when I remove the vacuum from the wand to empty it, the vacuum often dumps debris on the floor through the point where the wand enters. I never let it get very full and empty it frequently because of this problem but it still happens. It is also a pain to clean. I can't take the rollers out of the nozzle to wipe down the inside and pull out wound hair, etc. I would not buy this again."

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,18-Oct-21,Jun-50,Love this vac, I am so happy with the purchase of this vacuum.  It is so easy in to use.  I clean everyday.  The long battery life makes it possible to cover most of my house.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,7-Oct-21,Trip3,Great Vacuum," After researching the battery powered, stick Vacuums, I decided on the LG CordZero. It was a good decision.  I have mostly hardwood floors with a few rungs.  The CordZero does great on both.  The head of the vacuum slides nicely under sofas and beds that all of our previous vacuums could not get under.  It is amazing what it picks up...even when the floor looks clean!   The battery life is excellent and the charging stand is a plus. In addition, it is easy to clean out and the filtration system is clever."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,7-Oct-21,MaureenHFL,So Simple!, This is by far the easiest vacuum I have ever used. Easy to get around with and gets into all spaces. Easy to clean out and maintain parts. Love it!
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,6-Oct-21,Tony680,Powerful, Love the vacuum system so much bought two of them!
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Oct-21,Champs,Best Purchase Ever, Most of the time purchasing a new appliance is not a tremendous boon to its functionality. This vacuum is different. It makes vacuuming so much easier and decreases the amount of time using it due to its superior performance on all surfaces. My hardwood floors and rugs have never been so easy to clean.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,29-Sep-21,kbyrd,"Awesome, makes clean up easy."," i bought this a month ago, amazing works great love not having to find an outlet plug into! Very quiet and i give it a five star review"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,21-Sep-21,Rrcr,Much better than my overpaid Dyson.. loved the fact it...,Much better than my overpaid Dyson.. loved the fact it comes with a stand and an extra battery.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,21-Sep-21,Miss Patt,LG Cord Zero AMAZING," So very pleased with my purchase of the LG Cord Zero.  I've been a Kirby girl for many years.  Loved the self-propelled feature, but not pulling that power cord.   The LG is adjustable, has awesome power, no cord, two attachments and an extra battery! This is making me a domestic diva for sure! Very easy to change parts that all fit on the stand."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,13-Sep-21,Gramps67,Sucks very well," It's great for cleaning RIGHT NOW when the crumbs, dirt, or whatever are visible. Just grab it from the dock and get er done. Easy peasy...no going to the closet, unwrapping the cord and dragging this much heavier machine around and then wrapping the cord back up.
So much easier with my new LG"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,4-Sep-21,BevF,Easy to use, Very fast and easy to access. I love the extra battery and how the base holds all the attachments that normally get lost in a closet. Very nice vacuum!
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,3-Sep-21,lpspeck,Our Best Vacuum!, Bought this in December 2020. This has been the best vacuum for all the dog hair and dust bunnies! Keeps the pressure off of the Roomba robot. We do use it in Turbo mode most of the time for the additional suction but this is our easiest vacuum to clean and maintain ever and it picks up everything with little to no loss of suction.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,3-Sep-21,mark mat,Excellent," We bought this vacuum because we have 2 dogs in the house. It is lite and very easy to use and works just as described. We have not yet ran out of charge while using it, though 20-25 minutes is really the longest we used it. The turbo power is great for getting the hair from under the table or couch. The clean out of the container is so easy.
This vacuum is perfect for us."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,1-Sep-21,bslgolf54,Best Cordless Vac,"I purchased this vacuum because we have a two story home.  I have a Dyson on the lower level and it hardly keeps a charge long enough to vacuum the lower level.  When my upstairs vacuum started to die, I purchased this LG A9 and love it.  My cleaning lady loves it too....she says it's her favorite and she uses a lot of vacuums."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,29-Aug-21,Jsimppat,Easy to use., Cordless makes quick pick up easy.  Two batteries needed to do whole house.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,29-Aug-21,BevH,"Light and easy to maneuver, good suction"," Great product..I have mostly hardwood floors and a few area rugs and 3 dogs.  It does a great job.  The batteries last more than I would vacuum (on the regular setting) It is light and easy to get in tight places and the vacuum heads are easy to clean and remove long hairs.  The only downside is the canister is small, so more emptying, but I'm ok with that considering all the other good features."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,26-Aug-21,soonergal,Great for pets and hardwood floors, We bought this as something we could use every other day or so vs bringing out our bigger vacuum.  It works great on dog hair!!  We have 2 in the house and are constantly needing to get dog hair off the floor.  It empties easily and doesn't cause a mess!
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,15-Aug-21,Dawn09,Love it!," I bought this about 4 months ago so I have had time to see how it works. I researched cordless vacs online extensively before making my decision. I live in a 1200 sq ft condo with hardwood floors. I definitely wanted the soft roller attachment for the floor. That was a must and I use it the most. The carpet attachment works great on my area rug and I use the furniture attachment on the couches and chairs. 

This vacuum is awesome. It is easy to use and easy to clean. I watched an LG video on the vacuum maintenance and that was helpful. I am always amazed at how much dust and dirt it picks up. It is easy to dispense and is not too loud at all. I also made my decision on the fact that it has 2 batteries. I run the battery until it dies then switch them out, recharge that one, and use the second until it wears out (which is after several uses). I love how easy it is to quickly vacuum up crumbs and put it back on its stand.

I am very happy with this vacuum and highly recommend. These vacuums are not cheap and reviews really helped me make my decision so I felt it important to give my positive opinion and experience."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,11-Aug-21,JChin,What an amazing cordless vacuum!!!!, I bought this about a month ago. It is wonderful!  You can adjust the handle to fit your height.It is unbelievable how much dog hair it picks up on a daily basis.  So easy to use! I wish I would have gotten it a long time ago!
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,3-Aug-21,Marcey,Greatest light-weight vacuum," I purchased this vacuum for my wife a month ago and according to her is the best and most versatile due to being cordless and light weight. The two main attachments for hard floors and carpet make it unique. Even beyond that it can be used hand held for smaller surfaces, couches, etc. In all attachment variants it does not loose its suction power. It is truly an awesome product."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,27-Jul-21,HomeDepotCustomer,So far I'm very pleased....,So far I'm very pleased.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,27-Jul-21,Jenny12,Lightweight and does a great job, I love this vacuum - great suction - sucks up the hair from my pets on my mostly hardwood floors. Having two batteries is great - can do my whole house without waiting for a recharge. I only wish it had a larger bin - maybe because I have 2 dogs and 2 cats I have an overabundance of pet hair and can get a little annoying to empty the bin multiple times.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,1,14-Jul-21,Sangrias,Broke easily,"Bought six months aho, use a couple times, rotating  brush broke, cannot use anymore."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,1,12-Jul-21,Still like LG,No more than 3 months, Roller motor start making loud noise and smells burning in 3 months.... even I often cleaned up the roller.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,7-Jul-21,Tymamael55,So easy to use," It’s powerful, even at the medium power. Lightweight, easy to keep powered up."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,2-Jul-21,bluesfan311,"So Far, So Good"," I've had this vacuum for a couple weeks now and so far I'm very impressed with it's functionality, versatility, build quality, and ease-of-use. I find myself using this vacuum a lot more often than any other vacuum I've owned in the past. Probably due to just how easy it is to pick up and get started. I love the charging stand it comes with and all of the attachments provided. The two batteries give me enough 'juice' to get through my whole house without missing anything. There is one thing I would consider to be somewhat problematic. It's basically just how often you have to empty the waste canister. It's quite small and fills up really quickly from all of the junk the vacuum sucks up. It's a good and bad thing, I guess. I wish LG would have some sort of product that would make cleaning the canister out a bit easier and less of a mess as well. Your hands can get dusty and dirty if you have to reach in it and pull out the hairballs that get stuck in there. Otherwise, I really like the convenience and cleaning power this little stickvac provides."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,2-Jul-21,Daniel65,Excellent small vacuum!, Purchased this to replace a Dyson of similar size. This unit  far out performs the Dyson. More powerful suction that you can control. In addition the tools that come with it attach easily and are more practical for home use.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,2-Jul-21,Anonymous,Exceptional Products,"A true handheld and ""stick"" vacuum. There's a detachable head for every surface - hardwood, carpet, corners, upholstery - and the versatile storage options are brilliant. An optional knob for storing the mattress/upholstery attachment would make this home improvement product a masterpiece."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,25-Jun-21,kpotter,So many ways to use!," We love this vacuum! With all the different attachments we are able to not only vacuum the floor/carpet, but the celling fans, hard to reach areas and even our car! Plus it is so light weight and easy to use and extend. I defiantly recommend!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,24-Jun-21,Seasoned Buyer,Awesome Product,Purchased to replace a Dyson.  Definitely glad I made the purchase.  Love having two batteries and a floor and carpet attachment.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,22-Jun-21,Husband1949,Great on hardwood floors," I bought this for picking up grass the dogs carry in from the yard.  The head with the velvet covering works great.  The unit is quiet, light weight and very easy to maneuver around chair legs, etc.  The adjustable height is a real plus."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,20-Jun-21,ErnieP,I love this cordless vacuum!," We just moved into our new house and when we bought our appliances the salesman mentioned adding this cordless vacuum. Our previous vacuum broke during our move so I said, ""Sure, throw it in."" Let me tell you, I love this thing. I use it ALL the time. I use it for quick cleanups in the kitchen, vacuuming our entry foyer, vacuuming any light surface dirt on the carpets, and especially on the stairs. This vacuum is so light and easy to use that it's always the first thing I'm grabbing despite the fact that we have now also purchased a corded full size vacuum. I've always wanted a cordless vacuum and I'm definitely glad I picked up this one. If you're on the fence about this vacuum, don't be. Just buy it! You won't be disappointed."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,19-Jun-21,Jay561979,Tough little vacuum!, From cleaning my cars to vacuuming my house the options and power this thing has can handle any task!
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,14-Jun-21,marelomo,works great., the stick kind of short that's why 4 stars other wise Great
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,14-Jun-21,Hillksb,So easy to use!, I bought this a couple of months ago and use it nearly everyday. I love the convenience of it! The charger stand is compact and neat. Grabbing a cordless vacuum for quick cleanup jobs is SO much easier than dragging out a corded vacuum. I also love the way the head swivels to get around furniture and into corners. Cleaning it after use is also easy and quick.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,14-Jun-21,JohnnysV,So useful," Always looking for the best. Dependable, works well."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,10-Jun-21,LeisaM,I'm lovin' it!, I love how light and easy it is to use. I can switch the attachments in a snap and keep right on cleaning. I love that it can get under stuff without me having to stand on my head.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,4-Jun-21,Bigbee3,"Solid Vacuum, but messy"," Great Convenience, I find myself using it much more than my old vacuum since I don't have to unwind the cord and find a plug, just pick it up and use it. It makes a great replacement for a broom and dustpan. As with any battery power vacuum it  is not as powerful  but I feel that it is good enough for most of my needs. The biggest issue I have is that it is a very messy process to empty the dustbin. Hair, etc gets stuck in the dust bin and requires you to remove the filter which causes dust to fly everywhere a bag or a better method for emptying the vacuum would make this perfect."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,28-May-21,Joe2202,I love my new vacuum, It’s so light weight and I love that it’s cordless!
homedepot,LG A907GMS,1,29-Apr-21,Lilmurph,Terrible vacuum would not recommend," Bought this vacuum a while back especially for me - I have a very bad spine and neck. It’s lightweight adjustable height and cordless ness was appealing. However, the small opening from the motor area into the canister is too small and gets clogged with pet hair, before the canister even has a chance to fill up. The design in that particular area is awful. I unclog more than I vacuum. Very frustrating that we spent all this money to help me gets around and contribute to household chores and it causes more frustration than anything else. Very disappointed."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,28-Apr-21,Glen 1234,Nice Product," Vacuum has very good suction and pick-up. Maneuvers easily on hard surface floors and short pile rugs and carpets. Battery life is a little short, but the two batteries provide more than enough power to do a 1,600 sq. ft. home."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,27-Apr-21,Glen 1234,"Light Weight, Easy to Maneuver"," I bought this about a month ago and have used it many times. Has good suction and pick up power. A little hard to use on higher pile carpet. Works extremely well on solid floors and short pile rugs and carpets, which is mostly what I have. Battery life a little short. but with the two batteries I am able to sweep a 1,600 sq. ft. house."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,18-Apr-21,ReneeAnnette,Great Vacuum for Household with Pers, I’m very happy with this because it vacuums up dog hair and dirt they track it quickly. Cordless is wonderful
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,17-Apr-21,AM28,Better than a corded vacuum, I bought this LG earlier this month and I’m so glad I did. So much easier to vacuum the house and not have to keep switching the plug outlet to outlet. The backup battery is great to have and switch out to finish cleaning. I found with one other rug in the house I need to push it a little more.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,15-Apr-21,Pat125,Light weight and easy to use!, I bought this for my new home that has mostly hard surface floors.  So light weight and quick and easy to use to clean up.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,12-Apr-21,Billiam23,Best Cordless Vacuum I've Owned," I bought this on a whim, thinking the dual battery setup would be nice for small messes in multiple rooms. The power and capabilities are incredible. This is the closest cordless I have found to rival a corded vacuum. It doesn't just slightly clean areas for a longer time than others, but it deep cleans like a professional plug-in vacuum for longer than many others can do much less work. Great purchase."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,12-Apr-21,Susan Jean,No holding down the switch," I am loving this stick vac. I really like that it has a stand and everything can be organized so neatly. As we get older, it is hard to hold the switch on a vac to keep it running and this one has an on and off button. I like that that it allows for the shortening of the 'hose' because that makes stairs easier to clean. The floor head doesn't have brushes so I expect I won't constantly have to cut hair off of it like my previous stick vac. The dust bin opens easily and empties well without a lot of dust escaping. It is a little pricey but so far I feel it is worth it."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,11-Apr-21,Rosie2021,so easy to use.," This vacuum is so easy to use, my grand kids like to clean my floor.  No cord to drag around, light weight, easy to empty the canister, what is not to like.  I like to vacuum now; this vacuum gets under everything, and around it too."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,9-Apr-21,Richierich22,Wonderful sophisticated vacuum cleaner," Love this vacuum! We got a second dog (beautiful German Shepard) and he sheds a ton!! The LG picks up great on hard surfaces as well as carpet (and not even in turbo mode!!). Love love love the attachments, the two batteries and the charging stand!! Well worth the cost so far."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,7-Apr-21,Andi62,Love this vacuum!," I have had this vacuum for a few weeks and I just love everything about it!  The stand is absolutely and game changer.  Having 2 batteries ensures that I can vacuum my entire house while not dealing with cords. The vacuum is easy to assemble, the extra power button gives you the suction you need for difficult areas, the design and extra parts are well thought out and all of it is ready to grab and use in seconds!   I am so happy that I purchased this and would do so again!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,4-Apr-21,Leo G,Great vacuum," Love, tons of suction, love the battery love
And extra battery"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,4-Apr-21,Cardon,Great vacuum," I bought this a month or so ago and couldn’t decide on LG or dyson  , I am so glad I went with LG it has everything I wanted and more. I love the stand. Very happy with this product"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,2-Apr-21,JeanP,Love this vac!!," I bought this little jewel about a month ago and am so happy that I did so.  We've just changed from an all carpet home to 80% wood floors and this tool make my life much easier.  It's a snap to get out for quick pick-ups and for keeping the area rugs spotless.
Good job LG!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,2-Apr-21,MirnaS,The extended attachments, I bought this Cord Zero Vacuum.  It’s so light weight.   I’m so happy with my new vacuum
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,30-Mar-21,Happycat77777777,Life is easier now!," I really do love my LG  sweeper. From the stand to the extra power to the light weight  construction, it has made cleaning so much easier. I like the fast cleaning feature but do wish there was a bag to keep down dust when I am emptying the cylinder. Other than that it is perfect. Love the red color."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,28-Mar-21,Goldie28,Quality Cordless, I bought this about a month ago and couldn’t be happier. It stores very nicely. It picks up just as good as my old Dyson cordless. It’s easy to clean up. It has very handy attachments included. It’s the quietest vacuum I own. I highly recommend buying if you’re in the market for a cordless vacuum.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,27-Mar-21,Aud1994,Lightweight!," I bought this vacuum recently and love it! It’s super lightweight, easy to use, and the wall mount feature is convenient. It also has two batteries so you never have to worry about a dead battery! I’m very happy with my purchase."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,27-Mar-21,Rickbowallin,Solid performer," This is my first cordless vacuum and first LG vacuum. I was hesitant about the ability of a cordless being able to do a good job. I vacuum daily as I have 3 dogs in and out numerous times. I am pleased with the good job it does and really the cordless feature. It cut my work time in half. 
I was sick of tripping over cords and having to change outlets constantly. 
If you are thinking of going cordless pick this one, you will like it."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,24-Mar-21,Paul20000,Strong power for carpet cleaning," I have a couple of other brands including dyson. This one has strong enough power to clean the carpet. Only drawback is the battery. Although it already notifies that the battery would last about 10 minutes and two batteries were given, still bit short. Hopefully, they will make little longer lasting one next version. Again, other than that, amazing. I relay liked the performance."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,2,23-Mar-21,Morrris55,Disappointed," Over priced, noisy, difficult to use on carpet. Has to be constantly cleaned."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,2,23-Mar-21,Boilermaker,It’s ok, For the price it really does not have great suction   The battery life is pretty short also
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,22-Mar-21,Steve in SD,Best vacuum in our house," Best vacuum in our house.  We have a house vac and an upright plug-in vacuum cleaner, as well as the LG cordless. The LG is by far the best vacuum of the three and we find ourselves using it all of the time. We used it primarily downstairs (about 1200 sq ft) on area carpets, tile, and hardwood. On most occasions one battery gets us through the entire downstairs, but having an extra battery charging in the stand is a great feature. We are especially impressed on the way it gets dog hair out of carpets. Surprisingly, the rotating brush does not get clogged with dog hair. Neither of the other two vacuums does as good a job. The LG is versatile, easy to clean, and easy to use. We find ourselves using it everywhere, in the car, cleaning out drawers and vacuuming furniture. We use it every day somewhere because it  so convenient and effective. It also has very efficient filters. Needless to say we love this vacuum. It is a bit expensive, but it is worth it."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,19-Mar-21,Catalea,Perfect for us," I asked early present from husband coz Dyson won’t last longer. I’m surprised of this. Way better and perfect for me. Easy to use, one touch button for start and stop. Battery lasts longer."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,19-Mar-21,Beautiful morning,easy to use,"So much easier to use, light where it doesn't wear out your arm, the attachments are easy to change.  I like the smaller attachment for the floors, you can get into smaller places and under furniture."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,16-Mar-21,MayG,Good product," It's really good product, battery life is excellent. I stopped grabbing the central vacuum after I purchased this. I have robo vacuums running on their own schedules but this is totally easy to grab for spot cleaning or vacuuming whole room. I don't need to switch to different cleaning heads based on hardwood or carpet. This work on both. Only thing I am unhappy is emptying the collection bin. It's not easy need to use some tool to pull out if something got stuck in the bin."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,11-Mar-21,Jasonslc,One of the best cordless vacuums ever," I think this was a great purchase, it is so powerful it last so long that I never need to use the second battery. But it’s awesome that it’s there just in case. I highly recommend purchasing one it is well worth the money spent as it saves me time and grief."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,10-Mar-21,Heidi130,So easy to use!," I wanted a great cordless vacuum for those quick messes or cleaning up after cats and kids and this vacuum is it!! So easy to use, great battery life but because there are two I never have to worry if I really get cleaning and want to do more! And being able to adjust the suction strength is amazing - picking up more than I knew was on my carpets. The turning head makes doing my stairs a dream - one handed ease and so quick/efficient."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,10-Mar-21,cindya50,Powerful machine," It is more powerful than it looks and the battery seems to last for a long time. The only “con”is that because the battery is placed high up (so that a handheld device can be detached and powered), it feels more awkward than my previous cordless where the battery weight was lower on the stem.  But I do  like the convenience of having a detachable vacuum, so it isn’t a bad trade-off."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,9-Mar-21,jasonp0420,"Powerful, Long time to vacuum"," I had Dyson before. But this is so much better. It is more powerful, more features, more attachment, longer time to clean and 2 battery. And the stand works very well. I do not need to make a hole on my wall. And I can store anywhere. And  I love this unique and contemporary design."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,6-Mar-21,Helene1,Very good vacuum,"I really love my new vacuum, It''s very compact and light, makes vacuuming a breeze, I use it every day because of my pets. I just wish it had more suction, it's pretty good but could be stronger. I put 5 stars cause it's a very good value and this vacuum is very easy to use and handle."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Mar-21,K19940,Awesome product!!, Received as a gift and am so impressed with the pick up power
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,1-Mar-21,Excellent product,Quiet and lightweight, I replace my Dyson for the cord zero A9 so much better battery last forever and I don't have to hold the button.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,27-Feb-21,Mister clean,What a fantastic vaccuum!," This is it! I can’t possibly ask for more! I’ve bought this vacuum cleaner about a month ago, & I’m so relieved for the first time to get such a unique vacuum! It’s lightweight, simplicity, functionality with such great features makes it such an outstanding package! I’ll give it a AAA+"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,27-Feb-21,Linda44,Wish I could upgrade.," I have been using my LZ CordZero for a month and I am very happy with your product. In fact, my only complaint is that I didn’t buy the product with the floor attachment. Now I find I can’t purchase that separately. I would recommend upgrading at the beginning. Love the color, the extra power and the stand!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,26-Feb-21,Anonymous,Very functional,"I bought this vacuum cleaner a couple of weeks ago. Installation was very simple and it worked very well. I am very happy with it because it is light, has no chords attached to the wall and the filter is simple to clean and reuse. I highly recommend the product."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,21-Feb-21,Dalene,Excellent vacuum cleaner,I absolutely love my new sweeper!  Starting with the package and instructions for use to using the machine!  Very easy to release attachments!  Very lightweight!  Easy to clean the filters!
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,20-Feb-21,DonTram,Awesome Vacuum!, Could not be happier. Battery life is longer than expected and having a second battery is great.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,17-Feb-21,MIRANDAC,As someone who is new to the cordless stick vacuum...,"As someone who is new to the cordless stick vacuum world, I have to say, I love this thing. I am a busy mom to 5, ages 21, 18, 9 and 3 year old twins and I constantly need to clean something up on the floor/carpet. I absolutely love that I can just reach for the vacuum and go. No cords, extra battery pack (if necessary) and several attachments, they all work beautifully. I have not had one bad thing to say about it and reach for this thing regularly. Honestly should have purchased sooner."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,11-Feb-21,CJ15,Great vacuum, I’ve had this product for about a month and it works very well. I can vacuum my entire house on low with less than one battery (1800 sq ft of wood flooring). My only complaint is there is nothing to remove the hair that wraps around inside the tank.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,3,3-Feb-21,Ram K,Good Vacuum," I ordered this product expecting two attachments .,, one for wood floor and another for carpet.I received only one to use for both wood and carpet.It would have been nice to have received separate attachment for wood floor.That is the standard for all vacuums."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,3-Feb-21,Terrytan,Cordless is best and easiest, I purchased this because my old vacuum cleaner went kaput. I was a long time user of Dyson but didn't like the new versions. This is so much easier to clean with and easy. It has great suction and the best part is that it it cordless making easy removal of dust on ceilings.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,2-Feb-21,Tt52,Long time for vacuum not hurting my hand," I am happy with the product, easy instructions to use, vacuum time is one hour before charge"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,1-Feb-21,prottiej,ON TURBO!," On turbo, this vacuum has suction like no other. It picks up hidden particles that would normally be naked to the human eye. I am very please with my purchase of the all new LG CORDZER0 Kompressor. And Folks I’m just getting started! The Kompressor is a terrific feature that allows you to press down all that dust, dirt and other debris to compact it in the storage container. It also makes it easier when emptying into the garbage. The charging base not only charges the battery plugged into the vacuum but it also charges a backup or what they like to call an accessory battery as well. So that’s not just one battery your getting but two batteries wow! Folks this is a must buy machine especially if you’re tired  of running over that pesky cord all the time; because with this machine you don’t have to worry it is totally cordless and light weight. Please do not hesitate to get out there and pick up a machine for yourself today and you’ll be happy to know you made the best choice selecting this LG CORDZER0. You’ll be pleased to know that with doing so your machine will be protected against parts and labor for a period of 1 year and your motor is protected for 10 years under manufacture warranty. Wow did you say 10 years? That’s right ten years and your motor will be protected and covered by the manufacture. Thanks again for taking the time to read my review and as always “Life’s Good” when you chose “LG”!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,31-Jan-21,Sunny A,Good product cores cordless, Quite and light with good pressure and extra battery
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,30-Jan-21,MARY,Powerful and lightweight.  Easy to carry upstairs. I am...,Powerful and lightweight.  Easy to carry upstairs. I am finally down to one vacuum cleaner.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,28-Jan-21,janeann,Convenient, This is my first stick-type vacuum and it is more convenient than dragging my canister vacuum around so I use it for quick clean-ups.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have a very hard time removing the battery in order to empty the dust bin.  It eventually releases but sometimes after several frustrating minutes.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,25-Jan-21,Kormicook,Very nice!!," I have a carpet and hard floor.  
Most of all, it's very good to use optional head. Very useful.  And suction power is better than I expected.   I think this is better than Dyson. 
However I don't know how long the battery takes.. but I am still very satisfied with it."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,25-Jan-21,PJN82,Easy to Handle," My wife and I bought the LG cordless and few months ago and so far we are thrilled with it. It is so easy to use, especially on hard work floors. The second head also makes it quick and easy for deep cleaning rugs. This was certainly worth the cost and have recommended it for our daughter and son who are vacuum shopping."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,25-Jan-21,helen69,Fantastic features, I bought this last summer and really like the two batteries and the turbo power button. Easy to clean !
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,25-Jan-21,EricGL,Makes Cleaning Quick and Easy, I have had my LG cordless vac for about 3 months and it was money well spent. It always stands ready to use and I’m vacuuming much more frequently. It picks up dirt and dust effortlessly and the unit is easy to clean. I highly recommend this product.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,22-Jan-21,Jozeyteddy,Variety of attachments for multi purpose uses,"We have 2 big hairy retrievers and live in sandy Florida..and yes it does the work...I mop everyday and you know a good vacuum..I also love walking barefoot on my tile, this is our new friend and soon to get another!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,22-Jan-21,Dave2021,Great Features & Performance," Purchased sweeper Jan 2021 after researching that it comes with #2 ""rechargable"" batteries, this feature alone sold us. On low vacuum setting we get 25-30 minutes run time and the suction has been very good at picking up our german shephard dog hair which in itself is a major plus.
When extra suction needed just tap the + button for turbo and those deeper pile carpets get cleaned very well.  The charging doc/base is fantastic, well done and thought out LG, we love it.
Sweeper comes with extra filter and 2 tools.
So far after 1 month of daily use we are very glad we purchased the sweeper over Dyson, yes Dyson, we have owned several Dysons and they never hold a charge any longer than 30 minutes and then you have to wait for it to fully charge and lose 2 hours waiting, with our LG just pop out battery and put in other one and continue sweeping while other charges. No more wasted time and expensive cordless Dysons for us.
Thanks LG, keep up the great cordless concept by using interchangeable batteries."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,20-Jan-21,Connie1971,Very light weight & easy to use, My husband purchased this for me & I was skeptical but it has been very easy to use. I appreciate that it is very light weight & I can just use it at the drop of a dime since it comes with a spare battery that is always charging.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,19-Jan-21,Sam2836,Easy and light to use..., Very well engineered product!  Easy to use and performs very well.  This product is much better than Dyson.  Made cleaning more interesting in our house...
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,18-Jan-21,Piney,Best vacuum ever," I was given this vacuum as a Christmas gift. Normally being given an appliance isn’t the most favorable kind of gift. But, with 1 dog and 2 cats I was eager to try it out. I had just vacuumed my house 2 days prior with my Miele canister, so wasn’t expecting much. I was seriously shocked!!! The amount of dust and animal that this picked up was unbelievable. I have a 2,000 sq ft 1 story home. I emptied the canister 5 times. 
I’m loving this vacuum and tell everyone I know about it"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,1,16-Jan-21,unsatisfied01,Don't buy,"Great vacuum at first; it cleaned very well.  However, the carpet head attachment broke at the swivel point after only 5 months of light use.  For as much as we paid for this vacuum, it should have lasted years

Additionally, when emptying the canister it requires you to stick your hand into the canister (and all the dirt) and twist the filter out to fully empty and clean it out.  You either need to empty the canister frequently, or if you use the vacuum too long the canister gets real full, which requires you to stick your hand deeper into all the dirt and garbage to get the filter out; its really disgusting."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,13-Jan-21,Anna1968,Good Performance, I received LG Cord Zero for Christmas.  I had a Dyson which was great!  I like the LG Cord Zero but hate the way you empty........dust stays attached to inside and you have to remove it everytime to clean.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,12-Jan-21,tmartti,Love it lightweight," This was a Christmas present from my children and it is wonderful. Easy to go around corners compact lightweight and powerful at the same
time, and very quiet. Easy to operate and came with two rechargeable batteries! Who does that so nice.I really like the charging stand fits perfect in my closet. Dyson does not have this feature."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,11-Jan-21,AJ42,Great Vacuum-Really Sucks!," I really like the weight and mobility.  I wish it had a way to turn off the beater bar and a larger dust container would be nice too.  It sucks up the dirt so well that you need to empty it a lot.

I recently went shopping for a new area rug and a lot of the manufacturers recommended turning off the beater bar when vacuuming.  I did manage to find a rug that I didn’t have to turn it off.  I actually prefer a rug I can use the beater bar because it will get cleaner.  This is just something to consider."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,10-Jan-21,Gman 64,Nice vacuum," I bought this in October and to this point I have no complaints. It’s lightweight, maneuverable, and has nice suction across hardwood and carpet. The battery gives me plenty of time to clean all I need to clean and the base is easy to place anywhere. I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,7-Jan-21,ohcoolhae,Great to use, Great feature! Light weight easy to use. Only problem is seems like material is plastic it gets broke easy.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,7-Jan-21,Auto guy 64,Great Vacuum," I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she absolutely loves it.  It is so quiet and can get under beds and furniture that no other vacuums we have had could. all the attachments fit perfect and effortlessly snap together and apart.  this is a very high quality piece of equipment.   
Before you ridicule me for giving a vacuum as a gift for my wife.  we agreed this year not to exchange gifts this year and she has been struggling with many other vacuums we have.
(one on each of the 3 floors and another brand of cordless vacuum that beater bar stopped working and recently fell off.  now she only uses this vacuum. it is easy to carry up and down stairs because it is so light and powerful enough to replace the other vacuums."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,7-Jan-21,Chamansharma420,Great quality and suction," This is the best investment we have made, great feature with two different types of rollers, easy to use and light weight. Definitely recommend buying it"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,6-Jan-21,GatorDan,Very Fun and Easy to Use," I have had this vacuum for over a year and it has changed my cleaning habits. Prior to this vacuum, I had an upright vacuum and I hated using it. Messing around with the cord, trying to figure out the best places to plug it in to minimize the amount of times I have to change it. It meant that I waited as long as I could to vacuum. Now, I vacuum at least once a day since it is so quick and easy to use this vacuum. I highly recommend it for anyone currently using a corded vacuum."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,3-Jan-21,RikinLucy,I love cordless," We’ve had this vacuum a few months now and I really do like it. I would love it if it only had a light.  That is the only downside to this particular vacuum. I love vacuuming without running over a cord or having to plug it into a different outlet every so many feet. It picks up  everything in its path, is easy to empty and super easy to charge."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,31-Dec-20,dawnb55,Oh my Gosh, had a  so called good Vacuum bought this one it was 10 times better the old one said it would pick up dirt it only worked for about 6 months this one is far superior love it and I love the way you can break it down to clean it. and put it back together again.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,31-Dec-20,Mgr5,Vacuum, Had it for a couple of months. Works great. Occasionally you have to unclog if it keeps stopping.  Ex a tissue that was hidden and got sucked up
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,31-Dec-20,CaptJon,Like to vacuum now, Nice amount of power in batteries. Have not yet used both totally while doing our house.  The adjustable height is very easy to use and solid. The maneuverable suction head makes it real easy to clean around difficult objects.  It is light weight and not fatiguing to carry about. Easy to empty and clean.  In short vacuuming is not the dreaded chore that it used to be.  Well thought out design.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,31-Dec-20,JAAAAAA,Light and easy to handle," Love it. Hand held vac is great for a quick pickup of dog hair, dog biscuit crumbs etc. Overall vac works greats well too. Only complaint wish it could stand stand up."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,31-Dec-20,Darren Wei,Great product," Already used for many months, it's a great product, I have 2 bedrooms, and clean every week, one battery is enough for one week's cleaning"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,30-Dec-20,Mrs Haugabrook,The cordless feature is my favorite.," I purchased it early Dec based on reviews.  Always wanted a cordless vac ( no more slinging a cord around ).  So far, so good.  Lightweight and quick clean up."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,3,30-Dec-20,Tiff90,Great features but it could be better., I’m having an issues with the batteries. Also getting the hair out is a PAINNNNN and the roller doesn’t seem to roll that well anymore for the hard floors but everything else is great. I see they’ve made some upgrades I wish I had the newest one because I feel like all of the errors were corrected...
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,29-Dec-20,Calnick77,Wife loves it!, My wife loves it because it is light and it has all the tools and attachments that she needs to do the many cleanup jobs in our home.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,29-Dec-20,Paulrlf,Makes a great Portable Vacuum!," Mostly used on tiled flooring. Found it takes awhile to go from Power mode to Turbo, so be patient it will work. A separate storage rack would be helpful for the accessory tools."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,29-Dec-20,norris47,Powerful Cordless Vac," I have used this product now for a couple months. I love the ideal of the extra battery with the unit, I don't have to worry about Product also has the ability to increase suction when needed, great feature.  The unit is light weight and easy to handle.  A great product for the price."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,29-Dec-20,DA1951,Works fantastic, Works extremely well and has great power at picking up everything. Batteries last long enough to get multiple rooms done at once and can't believe at what this picks up even compared to a corded vac. That's even at normal power. Love that there is no cord and I am truly amazed at how versatile this vac is.  Extremely happy with this product.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,29-Dec-20,Fr991a,No Cord, We’ve had our LG for about 2 months now. It does a great job. Much better than the vacuum that we were using. The best part is that I can go anywhere and not have keep plugging in a cord. I can clean tile floor and carpet.  An excellent vacuum with no cord. I would recommend it to anyone.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,29-Dec-20,LG ZERO,Compact and easy to use, I like the flexibility and ease of use. I do find that I always need to have the boost on for the suction to be good though.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,27-Dec-20,Bendental18,Great vacuum, I bought LG vacuum machine couple months ago and am happy to use it all the time. It is strong enough to clean the floor and is so much quiet. Design is also good and light to carry it.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,3,27-Dec-20,Nami,Ease of use," I bought this vacuum because I like LG products such as refrigerator and dishwasher.  For a rather petite person as I am, I like the accessibility and light weight with the vacuum the most, but wish that of more suction power.  Overall I am satisfied with the vacuum."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,2,27-Dec-20,house husband 50,"Light Maneuverable, Lacks suction power"," This vacuum sucks, because it doesn't suck. We have had this vacuum cleaner for nearly 6 months. It is very maneuverable, light, and convenient to use. Each of the 2 batteries lasts long enough to sweep our entire apartment so we have a spare battery for extra cleaning time. All in all we are glad we went from a large, heavy, bulky upright vacuum. Now, the not so good experience. We find the dirt cup annoyingly small, have to empty it half way through our 2 bedroom apartment. As for the suction power, it is quite under powered. I often have to resort to using the extra, extra power setting, which works better but shortens running time drastically.
If I knew all of this prior to purchase, I would not have purchased this model of vacuum."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,26-Dec-20,Anonymous,Overall best vacuum I have even owned," I have gone through a lot of cordless vacuums each year but no more as this LG unit is the best I have ever purchased.  The battery lasts past cleaning my entire home, the ease of cleaning the unit is simple and the unit works well on hard or soft surfaces by a quick change of the unit heads."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,26-Dec-20,N1672,Easy To Use," I purchased it over 3 months ago, and it is still going strong. I only wish mine would have come with the power punch attachment, but overall, I am happy with this product. Way better than my old Dyson. I would definitely recommend."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,26-Dec-20,JAM16,Best in class, I purchased this cordless vacuum and it did not disappoint.  The extra battery allows me to clean the whole house without recharging.  The ability to switch from carpet to floor nozzles is a great feature.  The freestanding storage/charging station allowed me to avoid having someone install a wall mount.  The adjustable length of the vacuum is invaluable with more than one user with different heights.  Taking the long tube off and using the hand tools makes this perfect for cleaning the couch and corner baseboards.  The filtration system is great and easy to clean.  Great vacuum.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,26-Dec-20,Chris Hunsaker,So easy to use and does a great job!!!, Absolutely love it....easy to use and does a great job!!!
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,22-Dec-20,Djw10,Verdict still out on Fifth star," I am thoroughly enjoying the ease of use with my new LG cordless vacuum. The two batteries are a nice extra although I have not needed to use this second one. The vacuum is easy to maneuver and light enough that it does not bother my Senior Citizen hand. It is quiet and seems to pick up everything. I use the soft roller for 90 percent of my cleaning as we have hardwood floors and tile. My only complaint is that the soft roller  will not slide under the edge of the kitchen counters to pick up crumbs, dog hair, etc. I have to use the crevice tool for that. The power attachment for rugs is amazing, didn’t realize how much dog fur had buried itself in the rug . Like the way it has its own parking place and does not have to hang on the wall. Easy to store near an outlet in the laundry room. Definitely a good buy, hopefully it will be as durable as it looks"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,21-Dec-20,Mom Mom to two,Light and Easy to use, Bought this a few weeks ago. Was looking for a good product that would work for several floor surface.  It is light and easy to switch between accessories.  I love it!!
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,16-Dec-20,The Nashster,Simple quick cleaning!," I can't believe how much this vacuum picks up. It has more power than I could imagine , being that it is so quiet. If you want a quick efficient clean up this vacuum delivers."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,15-Dec-20,Pancake,Convient, It works as described.  love the way it can be transformed for smaller areas like a car etc...
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,14-Dec-20,27-Jul,"Great product, smart design, love ?? it !!"," Excellent cordless vacuum, no complains so far I recommended it to my family and friends !!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,14-Dec-20,Indy guy,A smart purchase," So easy to just grab it and clean up our hardwoods and carpets. Especially like how versatile it is to adjust from full vac to a handheld to use on stairs, blinds, etc.  At time we wish it had a little more power to pick up the bigger stuff, but, otherwise, well worth the purchase price."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,13-Dec-20,CUPCAKE 3160,Great for Quick pick-ups...," I bought this as the re4bate given with my WASHER & DRYER required the purchase of three LG products. I was a little skeptical at first, as I am a firm DYSON user...However 
after I tried the LG I will never go back."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,12-Dec-20,Taky,easy to use, My wife and I find the cordzero extremely easy to use - very lightweight and easy to assemble . Great cleaning ability and quick charge. Picks up everything . Glad we bought it!
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,12-Dec-20,Tinkun,Quick and easy,"I had my doubts at first, but this little guy does exactly what it should. So much less cumbersome than either of my other vacs. Great for quick clean ups. Took a little getting used to, but I use it with ease now."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,11-Dec-20,Eyegoofed,Convenient and multiple accessories, If this had led lights i would of kept it but not having a well lit home kept me from seeing just how effective it was. Quite and powerful otherwise
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,11-Dec-20,Gregory 009,Extremely Flexible," I brought this product in October 2020. It has been a great experience using this vacuum cleaner. This LG product is made with high-quality material. The pickup power is excellent and the battery life is good. The vacuum cleaner comes with 2 batteries, smart thinking on LG part. I like the futuristic look that it has. The long warranty on the motor is a huge plus! I own other LG products and have been extremely happy with them. LG has proven that they can make high-quality products. I highly recommend this LG vacuum cleaner."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,3,11-Dec-20,TheCommish,"Works well, build quality and durability???", Our new LG vacuum has gotten a lot of use and it does a thorough job. It is able to vacuum places that my still perfectly running 50 year old Kirby cannot easily reach. It doesn't seem to be made of very durable materials and the carpet cleaning attachment has already lost the felt strip that covers the bottom edge.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,11-Dec-20,Gail47,Great Vacuum, I bought this vacuum in April of 2020 and am very happy with it. I’m using the stand that came with it- did not have to attach it to a wall- and it is so convenient. And I love having two batteries (they are very easy to change). The attachment for the hardwood floors does a great job picking up dust and the one for rugs is great too. I’m very happy and satisfied with my  LG Cord Zero Vacuum!!!
homedepot,LG A907GMS,3,11-Dec-20,Rollingk,Hard to clean the dust cylinder," The product is good. Beautiful design.
The power feels little weak when it is in normal mode. The power mode feels strong but only last less than 10 min(!)
The dust cylinder is hard to clean especially with hairs"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,11-Dec-20,Shar123,"Easy cleanup ,light weight", So happy ! Not using my heavy vac any more . Easy to use
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,11-Dec-20,ma121,No Cords and Light Weight, I bought this several months ago and love the convenience of no cords and light weight. Doing the stairs is so much easier and the car.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,11-Dec-20,John May,What was I thinking??!!??," I've always had the top-of-the-line vacuums for my floors and they have been great, but even the lightest and best engineered of them were, well, lugging around a vacuum, if you know what I mean. Not a chore I looked forward to. I caved into household pressure and tried out my LG stick and now I look for an excuse to grab that off the charger and vacuum! What a pleasure and powerful machine. Love it!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,11-Dec-20,Paaaa,A great Vac, The LG vac is easy on my back because of the height adjustment and light weight. We were able to vacuum the house and then the car (using it like a hand-held vacuum) because the two batteries extended the battery life time.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,10-Dec-20,Chickie47,What a vacuum!, Bought this vacuum for my wife after she read the reviews. ABSOLUTELY great and no cord to plug in either. She even showed me all the dirt her old vacuum did NOT pick up. Great product.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,7-Dec-20,Sunny Day,Does Exactly What I need," It's been 2 months since I purchased my Cordless Stick Vacuum and it does exactly what I need as well as exactly what was promised.  
I wanted something cordless and light weight for small clean up around a cat litter box, so it's probably being used less than the average person would use it.  But for me it's a huge plus not to have to drag out my upright vacuum and although my Dust Buster works well,  at 74 years old it's hard for me to keep bending over to use it.  So, my upright LG stick fits the bill.
In case you wonder how much litter could there possible be, my kitten has decided the litter box is a beach and spends time literally diving into the ""sand"" and rolling around.  Litter everywhere!
I have used it on my carpets every so often and it works just fine.  I have to empty it after every use but that's easy to do so it's not a problem to me.
It stands in the corner of the ""kitty room"" out of the way and by an outlet so it's charged whenever I need it."

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,3-Aug-20,Paolosmom,Terrific product;, After 4 Dyson I decided to make the switch to LG and am I glad I did. The 907 GSM is a quiet unit that cleans well. The only issue is the manual which is worthless.

homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,19-May-20,sahab,"Should be 5 star, but for the instruction manual"," Instructions should be clearer. Floor and carpet nozzle is the same. Write floor/carpet, not one or the other. Explain punch nozzle better. Can you charge the second battery at the same time? How? Pre-filter should be washed under faucet (per picture). What about the other two filters, dish washer? Carry over accessories numbers all through out. Thank you."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,9-May-20,Rick1225,Love it," Very light

Very lightweight
Great suction power
Good battery life
Great for carpeted stairs
Very good with pet hair pickup
Really quiet ( surprised how quiet)
Excellent maneuverability

Improvements
Little bigger canister (not huge)
Small wheels always get pet hair caught
Very expensive"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,21-Apr-20,John4980,Best Vacuum Ever, I bought this after reading a lot of reviews that compared it to the Dyson models. This vac is way better than the Dyson I had before. The filters are super easy to clean and the parts are easy to switch out.  It's super quiet and very powerful. I couldn't believe the suction power on this thing.  I love that it charges 2 batteries at once so you'll never run out of power. Great investment!
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,1-Apr-20,RJ,"This vaccine cleaner is outstanding.   It is lightweight,...","This vaccine cleaner is outstanding.   It is lightweight,  uses a portable power station making it convenient to store cleaner in any room, exceptionally quiet, comes with 2 batteries,  easy to clean and does an exceptional job cleaning carpets."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,24-Mar-20,Anonymous,Better than Dyson in every way!, I bought this red model about a month ago and I was awed by the performance.  The best vac I ever used so far.  It's a bit pricey but you get what you paid for!  If you want the cheap knock offs then you will find many of them elsewhere; not here.  Well engineered and great design; performance is at the top level!
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,17-Mar-20,Rizwan,Beats Dyson by Miles," I was looking for a easy to use and maintain Vacuum Cleaner. I bought a Dyson one and it was good but then I cam across this innovative vacuum by LG which has surprised me by its design, its features and how easy and convenient it is to use. Great engineering and design minds behind this amazing innovation."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,2-Mar-20,Melb7,Awesome. Truly the best," The LG vac is way beyond excellent all around! Sucks like a demon, quiet, fun to run and (my SO and I fight to use it) and it is well engineered."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,22-Feb-20,Patrick_R,Light and powerful!!,"I'm a new owner and extremely pleased so far. The LG is not only light and stylish, it's several times more powerful than my previous stick vacuum. The attachments are well thought out, and the brush heads are quite easy to attach, change, and remove. The vertical stand is a plus as well. This unit will replace my older vacuums for all but the toughest jobs. It's expensive, however, and I hesitated for a while before taking the plunge. But when my old (and much cheaper) stick vacuum finally bit the dust, I went for the LG and I'm glad I did. Since it's new I can't testify as to its durability yet, but it shows every sign of being very well-made."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,21-Feb-20,Eileen and John,Easy to use!," Overall we are very happy with the vacuum!  The battery life could be a little better but having 2 batteries does help!  Really like the freestanding stand, but wish the vacuum had led lights."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,5-Feb-20,Engr,Very quiet," Had to do a double take that a vacuum this quiet could move enough air to be effective, but it does! The carpet attachment does a good job of brushing and vibrating the carpet to clean it very well. This unit does not come with a hard/wood floor attachment that is included in the more expensive model with all of the accessories. Although the carpet head worked OK on wood floors the hard floor head should be better. LG identified that head attachment as AGB74192409 for N.A. and AGB74192403 for other countries."

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,23-Jan-20,JC SGF,I love this vacuum!!!," I love this vacuum!!!!!  I have retired my broom!  I use it every-other day and it zips around my house and grabs dust bunnies, crumbs and pet hair like a champ! 

I love how light it is and the attachments make it perfect for any job.

Keep in mind that it is in the ""stick vacuum category"" which means you will still need a full size vacuum if you want to do your whole carpeted house but if you have berber carpet or wood or tile floors with area rugs this vacuum is the answer!

Also the quality of the build is top notch!  way to go LG!!!!!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,21-Jan-20,johnre07,Mr," It is so convenient to just use the vacuum cleaner and not have to go around the house plugging and unplugging the cord,  It is much lighter in weight and it does a great job.  My wife 
also enjoys watching me use it."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,9-Jan-20,xcitableboi,Customer Support is terrible!," I would have given this vacuum a five star rating except the process of trying to order it from LG was horrible. The problem was that LG would not accept my credit card ( no problems with any other orders. I called order support team on several occasions.When they couldnt resolve the problem they told me they were escalating my call to the executive team and then put me on hold for thirty minutes or more and then transferred me to the wrong departments! Finally, I decided to use paypal and teat worked fine. But the customer support experience left a really bad taste in my mouth."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,7-Jan-20,Alexxis,Love it!, I replaced a 3 years old Dyson with the  LG Zero. I love it in the very first minutes after unpacking it. It is very silent and vacuums better than Dyson.  Besides all accessories I appreciate the extra battery and self-standing charger and support combo. No need to ruin your walls anymore.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,1,20-Dec-19,Rebecca in Illinois,Does not suck,"I’m pretty disappointed with my vacuum. It clogs up almost every time I use it. It doesn’t have good suction. I thought it’d be great to get pet hair off the carpeted stairs but I still have to drag out the old Kirby to get the job done well. Generally speaking, it’s overpriced and under delivered."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,2-Dec-19,MacMike,Very impressed -- glad I purchased," I've had this unit for a few weeks now and I'm very impressed with it's power, runtime, and features. I always run it in normal mode and it has plenty of power in that mode to do the job well. I love the fact that it comes with two batteries and charges both batteries at once so that you can swap out during an extended cleaning session. I've gotten by on just one battery each time thus far. I like the various power nozzles that comes with it. I've only used the two floor nozzles and they work well and are easy to clean. We have two large long hair dogs that shed a lot and it does well with them but I have to keep an eye on the filter and empty it fairly often but that is an expected trade-off for the compact size. I would purchase this unit again if I had it to do over as I'm very happy with it."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,3,26-Nov-19,Auburn3556,A Little Disappointed," I bought this vacuum a few months ago at Costo (as a replacement for the the other high-brand cordless vacuum that I returned).  I really wanted to love this vacuum. The biggest selling point to me was the extra battery, and I know LG is a good brand as I have other LG appliances.  I loved the look of this vacuum and the charging base.  Much better than the other vacuum's wall-mounted charging station.  However, the first thing I noticed was that although it picked up quite well, the brushes are so soft and short that my carpet never had that 'just vacuumed' look to it.  I usually end up going back to my corded vacuum.  This one might be great for uncarpeted floors, but it just didn't make my carpet look great.  I ended up returning it to Costco yesterday."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,25-Nov-19,Eddie82,Lots of features," Purchased my vacuum cleaner around a month ago and I'm very pleased with it, Good suction, Easy to change attachments"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,21-Nov-19,gombear,A great tool for your place!," I live in an apartment where it has a wooden livingroom floor but has two carpeted bedrooms. The Cordzero works perfect for both floors and it makes so much less noisy then the other products! It is a bit too pricy, I felt at first tiem, but it's totally worth it. This is my first time using LG and am totally satified with the quality!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,15-Nov-19,bruce80,really cleans very well," standard and high power works great on carpet and wood floors.
liked this sweeper so much, bought 2nd unit for upstairs.
also great customer service with replacing carpet motor attachment."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,7-Nov-19,Anonymous,Absolutely handy and practical, I needed something that was good for my carpet and my hardwood floor. I have three kids and I’m constantly sweeping and I was tired. It’s so easy for me to pop the LG vacuum out of the charger extender arm and start vacuuming it works amazing and on my rugs I could use turbo to make sure that a get every single crumb. And as easy as it is for me to vacuum my carpet I can vacuum my hardwood floor. Which makes it so convenient no more back pain from using the broom. I also like that my five year old can also grab it and vacuum his room it’s like the perfect size for him when it’s not extended.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,6-Nov-19,ChiaraB,AMAZING, I won This vacuum and have been using it for roughly a month. I absolutely love it. It picks up so much dust and dog hair ! I’ll probably never go back to a traditional vacuum ever again
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,28-Oct-19,GreenClean,"Convenient, Lightweight, Great Suction"," This vacuum has been phenomenal so far. I went from a traditional plug-in Dyson to this, and the LG is incredibly lightweight, easy to pick up and use for spot cleaning, and high quality enough for large areas of rug and carpet as well. I own a cleaning business so it's important that it last, too. The second battery is a lifesaver and it's easy to switch batteries mid-clean."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,25-Oct-19,Sf88,Worth Every Penny, I was debating between LG and Dyson. This is the one of best things that I have purchased. Very powerful and light. Easy to clean.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,21-Oct-19,NaS8,"Amazing Vacuum Quiet, Light and Portable!", This is the best vacuum I have ever purchased. It’s light weight that even my 5-years old daughter is able to use to vacuum her room. No  cords means I can just pick it up and start vacuuming wherever needed. I also used the attachment to vacuum my car and no longer will need a separate car vacuum. Easy to clean and convenient!
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,16-Oct-19,DDaniels,I Love this Vacuum!," I have owned this vacuum about 2 months. What do I love about; 1) ease of use, 2) low profile, 3) battery life, 4) ease of access to hard to reach places like under beds and 5) the quality of the product. The batteries are easy to interchange and the vacuum has good suction. I have already recommended this product to my friends and family."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,2-Oct-19,Bere189,Cordless! Yes!," This vacuum has been amazing! I received this vacuum as a promotion in exchange for my honest review and I am so glad I did! LG has knocked it out of the park with this one. First off, the suction power on this vacuum is much better than my previous one. I own a 2 story home and the batteries work wonderfully throughout. I love not having to use cords! The portable charging stand is also very handy and takes up very little space in my garage. I highly recommend it!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,30-Sep-19,Sheska13579,Chore no more!," This LG vacuum is amazing! I've never used such a light vacuum, it really makes my chores less dreadful!  I appreciate the double battery packs and the long battery life (even though I pretty much never have to use the second battery)!  This vacuum has such great suction and design, I plan to use it for a very long time!

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,24-Sep-19,ireyna88,LOVE THIS STICK VACUUM," I really love this stick vacuum. Unlike other brands I've had, this vacuum is lightweight, easy to maneuver and has a long lasting battery. It does not replace my main vacuum, but it helps me keeping the house clean on a daily basis. We have a mix of tiles, wood flooring, and carpet and the vacuum does a great job on all of them. Also the adjustable height is a nice feature to have. Finally, the handheld vacuum is awesome! I mainly use it to vacuum crumbs of the table and my sofas. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review, and would definitely recommend it to anyone!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,24-Sep-19,goodch,This vacuum is amazing!!," Having had a new vacuum die within two weeks of purchase, I waited to see how this one did. I can report that it is excellent, easy to clean, lightweight, maneuverable, and effective. The attachments fit while also storing compactly. Being cordless and ready for use encourages use and quick clean-ups. The dust cup and filters are positioned to be accessible and easily cleaned. This is a great machine for the older individual being lightweight and for the fastidious cleaner as it can accomplish many tasks with the flexibility of attachments and compactness. Great machine! 
""I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion”"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,24-Sep-19,MelBell,Excellent vacuum," I’ve been considering getting a cordless stick vacuum to replace my clunky corded upright for a while, and I am so glad I went with the LG CordZero L9. It’s lightweight and adjustable, and all the attachments make it possible to clean everywhere with little effort. This vacuum is also much quieter than my old one, which my dog appreciates!
I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,16-Sep-19,Lpmoor,Lots to like," The LG CordZero has a lot of things to like. The continuous on switch is great. You can get a hand cramp with other brands from holding the switch on so long. Having the ability to change the battery is the best feature. For most things we've given up the old corded vac, but we could never quite finish the job with other cordless vacs. The ability to swap batteries is essential.
The ability to adjust the length of the vac is really helpful. The floor stand is very convenient and a nice option to the wall mount. Having an extra filter is great since you normally have to wait about 24 hours after cleaning the filter for it to dry. We have a golden retriever and the vac was great at collecting all of the dog hair. Our flooring is a combination of wood and carpet, and the vac seems to handle each equally well. 
The unit seems solid and appears to be well built. I'd definitely recommend it.

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,16-Sep-19,MikeNP,Awesome," This is my first review of any product anywhere. My wife had been complaining about getting a new vacuum, she wanted something light and had been curious about the explosion of battery operated cordless vacuums. She has shoulder problems and the weight and yanking cords around had become hard. We have a mixture of smooth tile, rough saltillo tile and carpets. The vacuum was a breeze to assemble, in fact my wife did it all by herself. We were both impressed with the availability of attachments and the local storage of attachments with the vacuum. Too many times we have needed them in the past and you have lost them or are searching for where they are stored. With this you just reach down and get them with the vacuum. The machine is seriously light weight, when first picking it up I was sure it wouldn't be a good fit for us, since we have 3 large dogs that live in the house and share their hair with us and the floor. I was wrong, It has great pick up power, and after We did the tile we hit the carpet and were stunned, it cleaned better than our current vacuum. We had to keep finding more to vacuum. we used it everywhere, all floors and even the cars. It performed amazingly well. We have already recommended it to at least a dozen friends and several family members,  We can vacuums the entire 2800 sq foot house on 1 battery, We haven't even needed to change batteries. Although I rotate them, do to old school knowledge of using them evenly.  We are very surprised and happy with this choice that started as a fluke and turned out to be amazing. I know LG has come on in the last decades, we own LG upright washer and dryer and have had them for more than a decade and have had no trouble at all with them. I am even more impressed with their products,
This has been a great addition to our house and even our kids like to vacuum and will without prodding, It has been great thank you. 
It would get 5/5 stars on any review from me, The only improvement I can think of is when emptying the hair, I have to pull it out, but the dirt and everything else falls out nicely. Love it!!!  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,6-Sep-19,Stiigg,Light and powerful!," Excellent cordless appliance. Very light so good to use with a bad back. Long run time and second battery is always there as a backup. Huge assortment of tools for just about anything you need cleaned up. Quick recharge time, like the turbo button if I need extra suction. Better than the equivalent DYSON product - it is stronger and very well thought-out and a quality build!  ""I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion"""
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,6-Sep-19,Anonymous,Lightweight and Efficient Stick Vacuum!," I don't have much space for storage, so I was pressed to find a compact yet efficient vacuum cleaner. This is it! It was intimidating when first unboxing the product... as there seemed to be several pieces. But it was honestly so easy to click each piece together in minutes, without even having to look at the instructions. I love having different attachment options for carpeting, hard floors, upholstery, small spaces and crevices... with an adjustable length. And the two batteries are a huge plus for a cordless vacuum! At first use, I was surprised at how lightweight the vacuum is, yet with a powerful suction. It glides easily and has a better reach than my previous vacuum (different brand). It's also just easier to move around more quickly without a cord and with less weight. I'm so happy with my new LG CordZero A9 vacuum cleaner! LG has gone above and beyond, once again. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Sep-19,Anonymous,Really works," I caught a lot of flak from the better half when I ordered the LG Vac. (i have 2 other cordless vacuums that are working fine just not like I wanted them to.
One competitor works great for the hardwood but is almost impossible to do the heavy rugs in the house. Battery only lasts a short time. I have to do the house in shifts.
The other competitor does the Rugs fine but seems to miss the small stuff on the hardwood.
The LG picks up all the small stuff on the hardwood great plus I can use it on the rugs with ease. I vacuumed with the old cordless and then did a repeat on the same area with the LG. We have a Labor-doodle that sheds, I was more then impressed the canister was full again way to go LG. The battery life is excellent plus with the second one ready to go its no problem doing the whole house.
I found the storage cradle to be handy, no holes to drill for hanging it.
I would recommend this vacuum, Great pickup,good battery life, holds a lot of dog hair.
The only con I had was its hard to get the dog hair out of the basket when you empty it, otherwise I give it a nine out of ten. disclaimer: ""I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion""   Thank you!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Sep-19,EODMIKEA,Phenomenal System," The vacuum comes in a compact box with the components expertly packaged to minimize space.  There is some minor assembly required, but it is very intuitive.  The system has the stick vacuum with power brush head, two attachments for use as a hand vac, two batteries, and a charging stand with a weighted bottom.  The stand is configured so both batteries can charge simultaneously which is nice.  The stick vacuum length is also adjustable through the use of a button just below the vacuum body.  I first tested this vacuum out in a carpeted room where my English Bulldog likes to hang out.  He sheds quite a bit but his fur and the carpet were no match for this little power house.  I use the vacuum with the turbo mode on since I don't need to worry about running out of power due to the extra battery included with this system.  This vacuum does a wonderful job and I found myself having to empty the canister much earlier than I expected because of how much it was picking up.  We had just vacuumed the room with another brand of stick vacuum the day before so I was suprised at how much it was able to pick up.  I also decided to use this to vacuum my car instead of dragging out my shop vac.  Not only was it much quicker, this vacuum did a great job thanks to the use of the included attachments.  It is a great vacuum and I would not hesitate recommending it to anyone looking for a stick vacuum.  Depending on how much carpet you need to vacuum, this may not be a good option.  If you only have carpet in a few rooms or are looking for a tool that can give an area a quick ""tune up"", this is your machine.  The design is well thought out and it only requires a small footprint to store it. 

""I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion"""
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Sep-19,MaxedMac1,Awesome Cordless!," Really love this cordless Vac.  Cleans better than any I've ever owned.  The beater brush head is like a soft microfiber and really gets into the small cracks and crevices of our hardwood and ceramic tile floors.  I also really love that the stand is self standing (you can wall mount if you prefer) but being able to just place it anywhere you want is really an awesome feature.  Having a charging port for the spare battery is really innovative and convenient.  The battery actually lasts quite a long time - we have yet to completely run out of just when vacuuming (~ 1500 Sq. ft).  I really like the way the different wands and heads also snap into the stand.  Everything is in one convenient location.  Looks really neat, clean and tidy.   The ONLY drawback I would complain about is the color of the battery - it's a horrid yellow and it does stick out in the stand.  This is very minor but it's the only con I've been able to find so far after about a month of daily use!  LG Really got this one right!  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Sep-19,ajnewman,Excellent power," Given the slender profile and lightweight, the vacuum's power and performance exceed expectations. The setup was easy- I chose to use the stand against the wall. Its compact and out of the way. The stand holds the vaccum and all attachments, plus it charges. The vaccum itself is light and easy to use. Extending the vacuums height is seamless and attachments are used with ease. Love that it can be used as a handheld, especially for cleaning the car. The device is powerful and offers a turbo mode. Cleaning is suburb. The vaccum is easy to empty and the filters are washable. Charging time is minimal and battery holds power for awhile. Overall, I'm super impressed! I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Sep-19,BetseyK,Best Hybrid of Dustbuster and Vacuum," I love my cordless LG stick vacuum!  It gives me the best aspects of a dustbuster - cordless, lightweight, and easy to use for quick pick-ups; and the desired aspects of a vacuum - power, height, wheels and canister capacity.  Now I can put my dustbuster and corded vacuum up for yard sale, and just use my LG stick.  The LG filters are easier to clean than in the old vacuum.  The only thing I wish someone could do would be to put a non-static, dirt repeling coating on the internal parts so that ALL of the dust would be collected in the canister.  Wiping the LG out is not a big deal, but some of the areas deep inside seem unreachable.  The weighted stand is great - sturdy and has a place for everything, to include being able to charge BOTH batteries.

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Sep-19,melissa666,Amazing Vacuum!!, I absolutely love the LG CordZero™ A9 Charge Cordless Stick Vacuum.  It was super easy to assemble!  I couldn't believe how strong the suction was.  It like that it has an automatic shutoff feature for when the canister is full.  The battery life is great and I love that the stand also had a built-in battery charger.  It has a spot to charge the spare battery as well as the battery installed on the vacuum.  Definitely recommend this vacuum!!!   I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Sep-19,Veekay44,"Easy to use, marvelous to behold"," We are getting on in years and have been finding it difficult to drag our old vacuun cleaner, trip over the cord,  to change the bag, and to use a different vacuumm for floors.  I just got tired remembering all this.   So, we got the LG CordZero™ A9 Charge Cordless Stick Vacuum and our lives changed.  I have frymogialgia, and yes the stick vacuum is lightweight, so much easier to maneuver, so easy, so convenien to empty, so easy to reach difficult spots, so easy to clean and change filter, and ... so easy to reach and use sucttion adjusting button.  This was made just for me.  No ... I take ut back.  It was also made for my 80-year old husband.  That's him happy to vacuum flloor and rug after 48 years of marriage. Two happy people here!.

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Sep-19,colagirl132003,Best stick vacuum I've ever used," So, I have had a couple stick vacuums, but this is my first cordless one I've bought. This LG Cord Zero stick vacuum is very stylish, lightweight, and love the additional attachment and the handheld capability. Upon unboxing it, everything was well wrapped and packaged, so scratches or damage to any of the parts. Assembly was relatively easy. 

The stand itself was heavier than I expected, but I prefer that over a lightweight one. The added benefit of being able to secure it to the wall or just leave it as free standing is a big thing to me. I love how the stand had a separate place to put the spare battery to charge and a place to put the additional attachments. I do love when putting the vacuum on the charger, you can see the bars for charging both batteries. Huge plus to me so that you know how much battery life you have for both batteries. 
The LG Cord Zero is very lightweight and easy to use. It manuevers easily underneath tables, unlike my other stick vacuums I've used in the past.  The suction power alone was what I expected. I did try out the Turbo mode, which is very convenient, but downside is battery will drain quicker when using this mode. It may last up to 5 minutes so either vacuum quick or switch out batteries if using this mode. The lines are are what I love to see when using a vacuum. I thought this wouldn't but I was wrong. My expensive one doesn't even do that, so it's hard to tell I even vacuumed. 

When using the handheld vacuum, it's easily convertible from full standing to handheld. The attachments when using the handheld are easily attachable with no issues. Very easy to switch back too. I love how you don't lose the suction power too when using the handheld, which has always been issues in the past. 

The only issues I had was emptying the canister. It seems stiff but I'm sure that'll break in at a later time. Once you get used to disengaging the full stick to handheld it was easier for me to empty it. 

I have really long hair and to see it pick up and have no issues with my hair wrapping around the rollers is a huge plus. 

LG went above and beyond with the laminated maintenance card. Love how it details (with pictures) cleaning the filters, removing foreign objects &amp; cleaning the nozzle. One side it has a FAQs page, explaining washing the dust bin, how long the battery will last, assembling the product, &amp; installing / mounting the wall mount.

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Sep-19,skburkett,LG CordZero is a keeper," Wow! I love my new LG Cord Zero. My husband was equally amazed by how much it picked up after our robot vacuum had already cleaned our bedroom. We have 2 precious furbabies, so we always have furballs around the house and dirt tracked in. My main use for this will be vacuuming rugs (so I don't have to get out the large upright vacuum) and solid spills (like coffee grounds...the worst.) I have never owned a broom because it is so aggravating to try to sweep up the last little bit. My previous cordless sweepers were handy, but not the best at getting every bit of a spill. The LG functions like a full-size corded vacuum without the hassle of changing outlets. It is actually quite attractive left in its charging station in a central location but easily removed if desired for guests, etc. It is a bit heavier than previous sweepers I have owned but functions much better at a weight less than a full-sized upright. I also expect this unit will last for many years, much longer than any I have owed before. Longevity will definitely justify paying a higher price.

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Sep-19,Techgeek78,"""Cordzero"" - the name says it all!"," Let me start by saying this is one of the best cordless vacuums out there at the moment. LG has put quite a bit of thought in this product and I certainly do appreciate it. To all who are sceptic about a cordless vacuum not having enough power, I would say otherwise. The LG Cordzero stick vacuum has a powerful 140w motor that is super quiet yet can handle any task thanks to the 25.5V lithium ion battery pack. The smart inverter motor is super efficient and has a 10 year warranty. This vacuum is light enough to vacuum our 2300 sq ft house without much effort and I haven’t heard my wife complain a single time since she vacuums at least twice a day with four kids in the house. We have hard wood floors throughout our house and several rugs and the LG handles all of it well. The best part about the attachment for hard floors is the spinning soft brush that is specifically designed not to wrap around long hair and clog up which is an ongoing problem with our existing central vacuum system that we had installed for a hefty price tag of $2800. Having a cordless vacuum means freedom, no cords or hoses to unroll as the case with our central vacuum system. One well functional feature is having one battery charge inside the floor stand charging station and the second in the vacuum itself which gives the ability to complete a bigger job without pausing to recharge. The vacuum and the stand is extremely easy to put together and start using within minutes. The stand is a little hard to pull apart if one decides to mount the charging station to the wall instead. So far we are very pleased with it and as far as reliability and longevity only time will tell. For the last few weeks of using the LG cordless vacuum I have been asking my wife every other day if she still likes the vacuum and I get the same answer every time, “This vacuum is amazing and super convenient, I’m extremely satisfied!” What can I say, clean house = happy wife happy life! LG you have done a great job with this product!

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Sep-19,mommyoffive,Handy Dandy Vacuum," I love this vacuum! I love there is a switch to turn it on and off vs. having to hold a knob to run it. I also love it has a turbo speed! All the attachments are easy to remove. I love the options for wood floors, carpet and for your car. It’s lightweight and easy to maneuver. The dirt compartment is a bit smaller than others so you would need to empty it out sooner rather than later. Overall I love this vacuum and highly recommend it!

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Sep-19,samsun,Elegant Cordless Vacuum," First Impression: Very solid build, elegant use and colors of materials. the  complete unit has a weight to it that implies that its built to last. Everything holds together and fitted with precision.  Give it a shake and nothing wiggles or clicks of loss fittings. The overall design is well appointed.
Assembly: The assembly took no tools (with the exception if you are going to wall mount the stand) everything came together in a matter of minutes. The smooth clicks as each piece connects firmly. The free standing storage unit has a solid weight holding it down, so you are not fighting it when trying to insert or lift away the vacuum. Also it has places to store the different nozzles and accessories. However, this unit came with 2 brush heads (one for hard floor and one for carpet) there isn't a place to store the additional motor-head. Which isn't a big deal, since my home is hardwood floor throughout, so i will just store the additional motor-head in a closet for if and when i may need it.
Operation and Performance: This is the first modern cordless vacuum I've used, and it has been great. it cleans up all the small dust and hair, easy to maneuver through out the house, under sofas and furniture. The canister is smaller than i had imagined, however it wasn't a issue with me.  
Last Thoughts: Overall I've very happy with this with all aspects. I will have to see if the performance changes over prolonged use and how well the brush heads hold up.

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Sep-19,Stang99x1,The new standard of handheld Vacuums," Having used hand held vacuums for quite some time from a multitude of different manufacturers, I like to think I have a pretty good grasp on what works well and what doesn't.  I've used both the high dollar expensive brands and the cheap no names.  In most cases each has it's own benefit and downfall.  Upon receipt of the LG A907GMS unit, unboxing it found it packed extremely well and thought out.  Assembly was simple.  Each attachment has it's own home on the stand.  I did get every attachment they offer, and there was one attachment left without a home that ultimately stays next to the stand however I don't really think that's a knock against them as I have a couple of attachments that could be considered redundant.  The appearance of the product is excellent.  It looks very ""space age"" with well engineered design.  The buttons are set into the handle and well labeled.  Attachments have a solid mounting design to keep them in place.  The stand is weighted for stand alone use. (I use the stand alone stand, mine is not wall mounted)  Upon initial use, it took only seconds to figure out the proper functions without the use of a manual.  The ability to turn up and down the suction allows you to conserve battery life, something few handhelds offer.  It also has the ""boost"" option for ultimate suction if needed in hard to reach or heavily soiled areas.  The bin is a work of art and you can see everything you are sucking up and watch it spin around in a cyclonic action.  I have noticed that the LG manages to keep the dirt and debris at the bottom of the bin, whereas in others the dirt would get up to the top and get stuck in the bin requiring one to use a pencil or the like to get the debris out.  The battery life is fantastic, and it came with a spare battery as well.  The spare charges in the stand at the same time as the handheld.  All of the attachments serve a dedicated purpose.  The big floor head works wonderful.   The extension housing design was a great idea and is light years beyond having an attachment tube to do the same job.  The unit has plenty of power, and when utilizing the boost feature it has immense suction.  In today's world of questionable quality and design, the LG sets the standard for handheld vacuums.  Once you get one of these, you'll wonder why you waited so long and your big vacuum will be relegated to the closet or the trash.

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Sep-19,Eli786,"After using for a month, I'm impressed!"," I have now been using my LG A9 CordZero Ultimate vacuum every day for the last month. I have to say I'm quite impressed. I have a few cordless stick vacuums by another top brand &amp; although I love them &amp; the convenience, I'm all too familiar with them losing their charge while cleaning. The fact that the LG cordless comes with a backup battery was huge for me! In normal mode, this vacuum works wonderfully. I don't feel like I need it to be in turbo mode to vacuum our wood floors--it picks up everything it should. I like to use turbo mode for our carpets however--but even so, after vacuuming all downstairs in normal mode, I still have plenty of battery to them vacuum upstairs in turbo mode. I do have to empty the canister after every full cleaning, but I'd say that's a good thing because it means the vacuum is picking up all the dust, pet hair &amp; dirt that it comes across. The LG A9 Ultimate came with 3 different nozzle attachments. There's one for wood/tile floors, one for carpet &amp; a small one meant for upholstery &amp; such. In addition to the nozzles, there were a few other small tools to attach. One of the other reasons why I really love this vacuum is that it doesn't have to be wall mounted. The freestanding base is sturdy &amp; sufficient. I can store it wherever I please, not having to worry about it falling over. As far as pick up power, unlike my other cordless vacuums, I feel like the LG A9 Ultimate can actually replace a full, upright vacuum. In my house it has. Since receiving this, my upright vacuum has been in the basement. That says a lot--we have 5 vacuums in our house, by 2 top brands &amp; I haven't used them since I started using this one by LG. All in all, I would highly recommend the LG A9 CordZero Ultimate vacuum!

homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,5-Sep-19,momadancer,Compact yet Efficient," I have to admit I was a little intimidated when my box arrived as I am not necessarily very technologically savvy and it looked like a lot of parts! That being said, it took less than ten minutes to put together the vacuum. (The stand is a separate project)

Once all put together and charged, I took this for a spin on my living room carpet, where my two cats like to snooze a lot. The vacuum is very easy to maneuver as the bottom pieces rotates easily in corners.  The suction is strong, meaning all of the cat hair on my rug was gone on the initial run of the vacuum!   

I noticed on hard wood floors (which means most of  my house) I had to use the Turbo feature often to pick up the smallest dirt particles and hairs. This is important to note because the battery runs down extremely quickly in this Turbo mode. Thankfully, the vacuum comes with two batteries, so you can always have one charged while you're using one in the vacuum!

An obvious point about the cordless nature of the vacuum is that it's......cordless.....but this is huge for me, given the fact that I have those two aforementioned cats. Vacuuming was always an adventure as they chased the cord! Now they just hide. The cordless feature makes this super efficient too as you can vacuum all around your house without having to unplug and set up in every room.

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Sep-19,momontherun1,Small but Mighty," This is my first LG Vacuum, I cant say enough about the LG CordZero Stick Vacuum.
Its lightweight - but has great suction - i was worried because when i was vacuuming it didnt feel like it was sucking the carpet up like other vacuums do, but to my surprise you could really see how well it clean when you were done, it left lines in your carpet from the suction - the container was filled - which is another thing. the container being small dont let that deter you from getting this vacuum, i have 2 kids and 2 dogs, plus one husband - we live in a plan so i probably have 10 kids throughout my house on a daily basis but our girls do soccer and even though they are to take their shoes off before going on the carpet it doesnt always happen. I was able to do both floors of our home and the steps, plus i did the kitchen/hall/powder room that is Ceramic Tile all with only having to empty it once. I was shocked at how much this held. As for the battery i keep it on the stand - i had no issues when vacuuming, it was still 1/2 way charged when i had finished.  I was really happy that i could do my ceramic tile with this vacuum and didnt have to change it over to hard floor or anything.. We have purchased other high end vacuums - very well known ones and they are big, bulky, and heavy - so happy with this one!! I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Sep-19,fishinggirl1,This thing sucks! In a good way that is.," Having owned a stick vac from a very high end manufacture I can tell you that they are nice to have. However, that same stick vac had a battery that was not changeable, and the battery went out. Sick of being locked into 1 proprietary battery I wanted to give this LG a try. I am glad I did. LG decided that it would be a good idea to make the batteries interchangeable which is amazing. I don’t know why all the other manufactures don’t do this, other than they want to collect repair bills maybe since you can’t change the battery out. 

Also, this thing has every attachment that you could want from a stick vac. It comes with a carpet attachment, hard floor, a vibrating power punch nozzle to kick up dirt that is deep down in furniture and more. It also comes with a telescopic wand that allows you to adjust to several different lengths, giving you the ability to reach almost any location, as well as not hurt your back when vacuuming the floor. When it comes to attachments, this vacuum pretty much has it all. 

One other thing that sets the vacuum apart from others is the ease of cleaning. You can take the pre-filter, fine dust filter, and the cyclone system out and clean them with water guaranteeing that they are clean for next use. 

This thing also sucks but in a good way. The low power setting on the vacuum seems like it may not be strong enough but, in my use, it has been able to pick up most everything. For the rare occasion that it can’t there is a boost mode that will take suction up 100 notches. I haven’t found anything that turbo mode can’t suck up. (When in turbo mode the battery won’t last near as long, but that is to be expected with how much suction it provides. For best battery results, use it in normal mode for most of the time and then turbo for those hard to clean areas.) 

It also comes with either a wall mount charging station, or you can turn it into a stand charger for those who don’t want to mount to a wall. With the charging station, LG again goes beyond the minimum and allows you to charge both the battery while in the vacuum, as well as the loose battery at the same time.  LG really has done their homework with this vac and we are so glad we made the switch.

homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,5-Sep-19,AbbeyD,Fur Ball," I was pleasantly surprised at the good suction and long battery life for the LG stick vac.   It's lightweight, easy to use and quiet.   I have a border collie and vacuum often, but found the downside to the LG stick vac is the very small dirt container, most of which is taken up with the center filter.  Long pet hair winds around the center filter making it harder to empty the contents.  Having an extra battery always charged is great, and the charge times are pretty fast.   Summary, great vac and features, a larger dirt container should go on the improvements list.  thank you

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Sep-19,matt137,The best lightweight cordless vacuum!, This vacuum is by far the best on the market. It comes with 2 rechargeable batteries that last 40+ min each. It also includes two accessories to help with those hard to reach areas and corners. The best thing about this vacuum is that it is so light weight! I can vacuum the dust on my ceiling fans with ease! I can easily go from carpet to hardwood to tile without having to adjust any setting. It literally picks up everything and deep cleans my carpets with little effort. I’m so impressed with lg. This vacuum has been a life saver with two small children and a husband. I’ve definitely got my money’s worth within 2 weeks. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Sep-19,Sharpet,LG CordZero A9," So far it’s been one of the best vac sticks that I have owned. I have four different ones. My friends call me the vac queen., because I have so many. But I do have to say this one has the best suction and I do like the 
fact that you can make it longer when you need to or shorter. I notice that the animal hair and human hair doesn’t seem to wrap around the brush like all the other vacs that I own. That’s a BIG plus with me. I like the fact that it shows you on the vac where to take off the the part to clean. How to clean is so easy.  I love that I can take out the middle piece in the cup to clean out everything. I lover almost everything about the stick vac. The one thing that is missing, it doesn’t stand up on its own. It has a stand to place it on, but you have to lay it down when you have to stop to move some. The Sharpe vac stick has found a solution for that. Maybe you could find away for yours to be able to stand alone.  If you fix that it would be perfect.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for giving my honest opinion"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,21-Aug-19,Anonymous,Excellent Vacuum," This vacuum is wonderful and so easy to use.  Being cordless allows me to grab it and vacuum quickly any time, which is often with a little one around.  Changing  the head unit and extending the pole take just one click of the slider buttons.  One battery's capacity lasts through my whole house.  Look forward to having this vacuum a  long time. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,21-Aug-19,Beachykeeneyed,Excellent Performance on Pet Hair," To start, assembling the LG CordZero was fairly intuitive and I put the vacuum together in about 10 minutes. I admit I didn't exactly zero in on the assembly instructions—and all came together in spite of my eschewing the how-to manual. (Tch tch!) 


I was especially pleased with the ""self-contained"" aspect of the LG—the ""freestanding"" station is fairly compact and it's nice to have all accessories neatly ""housed"" and at-the-ready so I'm not digging for them at some remote place in the house. The stand is sturdy and the vac is easy to lift  out and re-seat. The wand extension is great and adds to the compact storage features of the CordZero. You do need to bend down a bit to engage the lever that releases/extends the pole for a comfortable vacuuming height. I LOVE that the unit comes with a second battery! Be aware that you'll have VERY short vacuuming time in the Turbo mode—the highest of the three modes available on this machine. Run time is about what they indicate; so work fast in this mode as you'll only have about 5-6 minutes of operating time. (See photo for vacuum run times in the various modes.) I was pleasantly surprised that shifting between modes was easy and you can clearly hear the difference as you switch between power levels. 


The dust bin release lever is a bit stiff to operate, but it may become easier with time. My housekeeper noted she thought the CordZero was noisier than our other cordless vacuum. I hadn't really initially noticed, but had to agree after she made the comment. 


Performance? So far I'm impressed! I ran the LG for only 3-4 minutes on my small area rug under my sofa (approx. 6'x9') and I was rather astounded at the amount of pet hair (cat) and dirt that the CordZero picked up in such a short period, especially with the machine in normal mode. (See photo.) The pet hair ""ball"" was about 1"" in diameter. (And, interesting that the machine seems to ""ball"" up the hair.) I only have one cat and I was a little chagrined at how much this vac sucked up in SUCH a short vacuuming time! I haven't fully ""vetted"" all the power modes—but I was certainly awed with what transpired in the ""NORMAL"" mode in only a few minutes!


I  was also impressed with the laminated 8x10"" Maintenance/How-To card provided. LG even added a small suction cup to hang the placard in your chosen handy spot. (See photo.)

All in all a GOOD purchase in my book!

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,20-Aug-19,GatorDan1,Fun to Use," Vacuuming is a pain. I dreaded having to go to the closet where I kept my traditional vacuum and pulling the big, heavy device out. I would then have to figure out which outlet to use which would allow me to cover as much of the target area as possible. Then I would have to constantly move the cord out of the way as I pushed the heavy device around. To avoid this hassle, the alternative was to get a cordless vacuum that would be very weak and only last a couple of minutes, that is until now.
The LG CordZero A9 is very powerful, light, batteries last a very long time, and is actually fun to use! I find every excuse to use this. It comes with two batteries but I have never even used up 1 so I don't have to worry about it running out of charge. Another fantastic feature of this vacuum is that it is very quiet! No more having to time vacuum use at the perfect time so you don't disturb others. It really is as simple as pick it up off its stand charger and go. I can't, and won't, ever go back to a traditional vacuum or to a cordless vacuum that only lasts a few minutes.

homedepot,LG A907GMS,2,13-Aug-19,Deb1911,"Love the vacuum, hate the non-customer service !","I bought this several months ago. Really liked the vac, until 3 weeks in from purchasing it, the velvet strip on the carpet nozzle came off. LG took one month to send me a box to return the nozzle, and so far it’s been 7 weeks and no nozzle back. I have called them 8 times. Each time they say they will expedite my request to get it returned to me. TERRIBLE customer service!!"

It is powerful enough for the vast majority of our vacuuming and the light weight has made it possible for our kids to run the vacuum regularly.

The battery life is long enough on the low setting to get through our whole house of mixed hardwood, rugs, carpet, and tile. We use the regular power floor nozzle for everything except detail work where the crevice brush and wand work better. The extendable wand make this vacuum work everywhere for every member of our family. It is quiet enough to have a conversation while it is running. The turbo mode runs the battery down pretty quickly, but we have been getting longer than the advertised 6 minutes and have been able to use it for multiple rooms before needing to swap batteries

The charger stand works great to keep the batteries both charged and the vacuum accessible. It holds most, but not all of the included attachments, which seems strange. The power punch nozzle does not have a dock on the stand. I have not mounted it to the wall yet, but I will definitely do that. My children especially have a had time docking the vacuum without tipping the stand. I find I have to be pretty careful to get it docked one handed. This is partly because we keep it in a closet. When it was out in the open, docking was easier. 

The dust chamber is easy to empty and the filters are washable, which is a big plus. We have had some issues with long hair wrapping around the chamber and not dropping out easily, but it does not affect performance at all. 

This is our first cordless vacuum, so I can only compare to our older upright and canister units. This has all but replaced them. The only time we feel the need to use the corded tools is for getting sand or heavy dirt out of thicker rugs."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,11-Aug-19,Leelos,Better than expected," I’ve had this for a month any my floors have never been cleaner! I’ve had hardwood throughout my lower level for the last 5 years and struggled with keeping it clean. I recently added 2 puppies to the mix and it’s been difficult until I received this vacuum. It is so convenient, light weight, and quiet that I have no problems using it every day! With it being cordless and light weight I can now have my 7 & 9 year old vacuum easily.  I have carpet upstairs and keep my canister vacuum upstairs for the carpet but decided to test the cordless LG and was blown away by the hair it removed after I already used my other vacuum. This unit is very powerful."

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,31-Jul-19,Vgandjsmom,Worth Every Penny!," The LG vacuum is hands down the best floor cleaning device I’ve ever owned.
To start the packaging has such a high end , origami quality to the inbox you just know something amazing waits at the end of that yellow brick road . It built an anticipation that completely paid off.
Once all the parts were laid out I felt like a spy pulling all the pieces of a weapon out of their luggage . Ha! It was actually fun and easy to assemble.
Looking it up before it arrived I was prepared to mount it but I am in love with the weighted stand ! It makes it so easy to tuck it away and it doesn’t fall over ! I do wish It had one more tool hook so everything could be in one place...
Use: from the get go it’s intuitive to use. I’ve had that other famous brand of vacuums for years and had just done the rugs the night before . I went over it with the LG not even on turbo mode and it sucked up so much dog hair and sand I kind of felt dirty.
Having two batteries is amazing but the charge lasts so long I hVe never needed the second one. I find myself swapping them so the extra doesn’t get lonely!
Nothing seems to clog it, nothing seems to decrease the suction except the charge getting low. The different ends and configurations make cleaning literally anything a breeze. I’ve handed vacuum duties over to the 10 year old because the unit is so solidly built I’m not worried he will break it and it does suck a great job it’s almost as if I slacked over the old vacuum for an hour!
I’ve used it for 2 months now and I’m sold. LG vacuums for life !"

I like the portable stand. You can either hand it on the wall, stand it up or use it in the compact size. With these options it can be stored anywhere. The vacuum itself is not very loud when it is running. It turns on and off easily with a single button pushed with your thumb. It has two speeds. There are several attachments with a separate head for hard floors and carpet. I like that because the hard floor head is a soft washable head that picks up dust along with the heavier dirt. The wand is adjustable for the height can be set to what is comfortable. My grandson loves to help vacuum and fits him too and he is only 5. Also takes up less storage space that way. It also adjusts simply to a handheld vacuum. The filters are washable. About the only complaints I have is there is not enough storage for all the attachments on the stand and there is not a light on the head. I liked that option on my old stick vac. There is also an added finger separator on the handle. Not necessary and not really sure of it's purpose."

It lives on the charging station and we’ve switched out the batteries and yet it still does this and only stays on for a few minutes before dying.

No more messing with the cords and this is plenty powerful enough and very quite. High marks all the way around. Assembly is easy with the hardest part being taking everything out of the bags and the protective covers. This is now THE vacuum cleaner for downstairs. It was actually embarrassing how much dirt came out of the area rug and it was very fine with it all being caught in the dust container. The secondary filter was spotless, I am amassed at how fine and the amount of dust it picked up. What is great about this is now when I see a few spots of dirt or grass clippings, I walk over and quickly vacuum it up, No more dragging out the old vacuum with the cords. It is so easy to now walk around the house and vacuum up what ever is around. It is so quite that I can use it while the family is watching TV, albeit on the lower settings not that the Turbo setting is all that much louder.

There are three minor drawbacks, wish all the ""heads"" had a place on the mounting stand, to get the hair wrapped around the silver filter I need to use a stick or other tool as my hands are too fat and final drawback, the battery meter on the stand is in a bad spot, would have been much better to put it on top instead of on the side. 

Overall a great vacuum and glad I got it!!!"

The box has ALL of the parts in it! You will never use them together; charger, a pair of batteries, the weighted stand/base, 3 motorized heads, mounting brackets, crevice nozzles etc.
The charging base holds the motor/vacuum unit (with a battery installed) and a spare battery in a port, to charge both simultaneously.
You can wall mount it or use the free standing base.
Noise is slightly lower than our regular vacuum, but high up since the motor is in the handle.
My wife used it to vacuum the family room (20x20), area rugs under the kitchen table and entry way (each 8x10) and the carpeted stairs going upstairs. 
In the about 20 minutes total run time, battery was down 1 'bar'.
The two filters on the exhaust side are washable. You can use the crevice tool as a 'wrench' to help remove the main dust bin.
That is why she needed a 'swiffer' to clean the space between inner and outer bin. She did not read the manual, but I did! 

My wife's comments about usage; 
""The head pivots, I like that, just takes getting used to"". 
""I like the no cord operation"", (probably the best feature for her!). 
""Take the tube off the unit BEFORE you open the the dust bin OVER the trash bin"". 
""I used a old 'swiffer' to clean the residual dog hair out the dust bin"".
""It's a good sucker upper"".
Later update - 
We have not used the other two ""heads""; I'd call them smooth floor (tile, wood etc) or the 'pounder' for upholstery yet.
I have it as a free standing in a 'dead corner', (not as shown in my pictures) in the kitchen area close to 120VAC outlet. 
My wife likes it there since it is easy to access and ready use...no cord!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,3-Jul-19,Starmapper,A great product with some areas of improvement. This LG Cordless Stick Vacuum (Model A907GMS) co...,"A great product with some areas of improvement. This LG Cordless Stick Vacuum (Model A907GMS) comes with multiple attachments, but it's not clear from the instructions or use what each of them is best at. Assembly in the “free standing” mode was easy until I realized I hadn't put the optional attachment holder on the vertical post before installing the post in the base. Removing the post was extremely difficult, requiring a thin blade and a hammer to release the spring-loaded retaining ball from its socket (see photo). The same issue occurs if converting from free-standing to wall mounted – any time the post needs to be removed. Filing down the plastic edges of the socket helps, but does not eliminate the problem. Also, there is no ability to store all the attachments that come in the kit, and freeing whichever of the two shorter attachments (brush and crevice tool) is stored in the rear may require removing the other for access.
 In use, the vacuum is quiet and each battery lasted for about 25-30 minutes in normal mode (non-Turbo). Suction is good for such a small, cordless unit, even without Turbo mode – more than adequate for most jobs but not as powerful as a corded vacuum. Maneuverability is excellent, and the extendable tube allows one to set the most comfortable height for use. The “finger tab” on the inside handle, which separates the index finger from the rest of the fingers, is functional but uncomfortable after awhile. Thumb access to the control buttons is excellent. Cleaning at the edge of the floor attachments isn't quite as good as on other units, so areas next to vertical surfaces (baseboards, furniture) might not be as easy to clean. The “Power Punch” head, which we think is used for upholstery, mostly pushes lint into a line in front of the unit, where it can be picked up manually. Like many modern vacuums, the small brush attachment is mediocre at best: the bristles are too stiff to be effective in dusting. Since the accessories are not standard 1-1/4” fittings we had to use an adaptor to fit a decent dust brush onto the vacuum, but it works well (see photo).
 When using the vacuum in the “compact mode” (no floor extension), there is no place to store the extension tube and floor head and, since it has a flexible joint to make it so maneuverable, it won't stand on its own, even against a wall. It's a minor inconvenience but it would be nice if the storage stand had a way to hold the detached tube and head.
 Since it's a small vacuum head, it won't store much debris and, because of the configuration, the debris can be difficult to remove from the canister – especially hair that gets between the filter and the canister sides. Opening the bottom of the canister is a bit awkward until you get the hang of it.
 All those minor issues aside, this is a great little vacuum. It doesn't have the power of a corded vacuum, but having no cord makes it SO much easier. We'll keep the corded unit, but are likely to use this unit almost exclusively thanks to its convenience. It comes with a pretty hefty price tag though, so you really pay for the extra convenience. Since I don't have experience with any other cordless stick vacuum I can't compare performance, but the price of this unit is more than double or triple other models with similar characteristics."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,3-Jul-19,Stoopy,Absolute best Vacuum cleaner I have ever owned!!," My wife and I have been a loyal Kirby vacuum customer for many years.  While a great product it also requires a good deal of muscle to operate. Having to lug it up each individual stair for my wife was my favorite use of a Saturday morning imaginable! I knew it was time for a change and this LG vacuum was the answer to our prayers!  My wife loves it and can finish her chores before I get home from work without my help so you know it's aces in my book!  The attachments are also awesome if vacuuming a house is not your cup of tea.  I have two small boys so cleaning out my truck once a week is a necessity.  The extensions pop on and off with ease and the small form factor and lightweight device allows me to get underneath and in-between car seats and tight spaces with ease!  Last but not least, my Doberman would freak out every time the Kirby was turned on.  She could not care less about this LG with it's quiet operating power.  I literally vacuumed some loose hair off her coat this week and she thought it was a back scratch!  Long story short, couldn't be happier with this product and what I had not anticipated is that it benefits every single member of this family.  Kudos to you LG!!"

homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,28-Jun-19,Katie 30,Wow! I like to clean now!," Okay I think I might be addicted to vacuuming now. This thing is a serious game changer when it comes to cleaning. I am a mother of a toddler, so messes is something I’m combatting multiple times daily. I love this vacuum for numerous reasons. The first being the nifty charging station! I am able to store the vacuum, the extra battery, the accessories AND charge the vacuum at the same time. Having this little station (I keep mine in the laundry room) not only keeps everything organized, but I am more eager to grab it and use it rather than it being stuffed in some dark hall closet. The second feature I love about this vacuum is how lightweight it is! I can easily vacuum my entire house without feeling like I just worked out at the gym. I also love how easily I can maneuver it, I can take turns like butter. The most important feature, and probably my favorite would be the powerful suction it has. Let’s be honest, a vacuum can possess all of the bells and whistles, but if it can’t do its job (sucking up dirt and debris) then it’s worthless. This sucker, (see what I did there? ;)...) definitely picks EVERYTHING up! And if you think it needs even more suction power, it has a button to do so! I honestly never find myself having to use this. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and review."

I mean, I'd just vacuumed two days ago, right? But once over that area rug and the bin was almost full!! Which tells me that this vacuum has a ton more power than what I've been used to, even though the old one was supposedly a good vacuum. I didn't like the old one because it was heavy, and I had to deal with plugging it in and worrying about the cord. This one? Awesome!!! And I love it being cordless. Be careful to read the instructions when assembling it -- it's easy to miss a step. But you'll love this vacuum, and all the attachments are an extra bonus! My only complaint is that it doesn't stand alone when you need to put it aside to move something out of the way. It does lean against the wall well, though."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,27-Jun-19,Jj1194,Super light yet powerful vacuum!," I got this vacuum a couple weeks ago and it is very compact, easy to use and has a lot of power. The kids love to vacuum now and that is a huge plus for my house. I would definitely recommend this vacuum as a handy companion to your every day vacuum."

I did not expect it to be so awesome and am grateful & pleasantly surprised! The quality is EXCELLENT! Estremely well made and thought out. It has an attachment for everything and they do indeed come in handy. The 'stick' extends to 4 different lengths, it comes with 2 batteries, an extra filter and you can mount it on the wall or wherever it will take up very little space. The accessories can attach to just the handheld part of the vacuum or attach at the bottom of the stick.
It is very quiet but do not let that fool you. Suction is perfect on both floors and carpet and it will pick up dirt and pet hair that you did not even see. It comes with so many extra accessories; you will not believe it. 
I love how I can store this in my upstairs bedroom closet, anchoring it to the wall or hanging it just about anywhere.
It was very easy to put this vacuum together and the booklet and quick sheet are very important to have. It's easy to empty and easy to keep clean. I know that I will get alot of use out of it and from past experience with LG products, I know that I can count on it's reliability & durability. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,26-Jun-19,conniesmith63,"I love the convenience and ease of use this cordless vac provides and it’s looks great too, even ...","I love the convenience and ease of use this cordless vac provides and it’s looks great too, even when charging on it’s stand. There are a few things to point out regarding this vac:

1. Assembly: This vac has to be assembled. I was a little intimidated when I opened the box and saw all the pieces, however, all of the components click together pretty effortlessly. I had no problem assembling the vac and the charging station in less than 30 minutes ( and this includes reading through the instructional booklet provided). Once assembled, the vac battery needs about 3.5 hrs to charge before using. One great feature is having an additional battery provided with an auxiliary charging area on the stand. This vac can be used as stick vac for floors or a handheld. LG also provides several attachments- two for cleaning floors, a crevice tool, a narrow brush tool, and a smaller nozzle that can be used to clean upholstery. 

2. Operation: Handling the vac took a little getting used to. The canister is at the top, and so the weight of the vac is concentrated at the top. Once I became comfortable with handling the vac, I found it to operate smoothly. It has multiple power levels, but this affects how long the battery power will last. For cleaning our floors (no carpets), I used the default standard power level and this was fine. At this power level, the battery power will last about 30 minutes. If more time is needed, you can easily swap out the batteries. 

3. Maintenance: Cleaning the vac so far has been pretty easy. Once finished, the canister can be emptied by releasing a button at the base allowing the the dirt to fall into a trash container. I check the filters to see if they need to be cleaned ( I have used the vac about 6 times, and have not had to clean the filters yet). I wipe out any residual dust from the canister, and clean any hair or dust from the floor attachment.

Overall, I am very pleased with this vac. This is a cordless stick vac, however, and so it is not as powerful as standard vacuum cleaner. Additionally, when cleaning the floor, it has difficulty picking up some dirt in corners between the floor and wall. If you are looking for a cordless vac strong enough to handle quick daily cleaning, I would highly recommend this model."

I always knew L G made quality products. I have had a Dyson cordless for years and the L G blows the Dyson out of the water. Much more power, extra battery super great acessories an adjustable height extension wand and the list goes on. It has a wall mount or my favorite is the free standing stand. It makes it super easy to grab and do a quick clean up or with the battery life a thorough cleaning. Also another BIG feature is your choice of speeds. Normal,Power ,Turbo. If you live with pet hair as I do this L G is a life saver.Love it!!!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,25-Jun-19,Mpendergast,This vacuum is amazing!!," My husband is truly obsessed with this vacuum! It’s stylish, efficient and pretty compact! We keep it downstairs on the first floor of our home where there is a mix of both hardwood and rug. It works well on both surfaces. The backup battery is super convenient. Everything stores in the stand alone base. We absolutely love this vacuum!"

It charge pretty fast. It comes with two batteries which can be charged simultaneously. The vacuum has good suction which can be increased with the touch of a button but the battery wont last as long in this mode. It has interchangeable heads for the vacuum. It would be nice to get more detail on what the use the different heads for. Obviously carpet head is for carpets but floor head, what kind of floor? One has a like a velvet roller that looks like it would shine the floor but havent found any info on it. All in all is a good vacuum. Being cordless is a great feature."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,23-Jun-19,jnk52,awesome, I never used a stick vacuum before so I wanted to do a test. I used my old vacuum then went over it with the LG vacuum. This vacuum picked up dirt that was left behind from my old vacuum. it comes easy to install and a dock to store it. I like how it has a regular speed and a turbo speed. it come with an extra battery and the dock can actually charge the vacuum and the spare battery at the same time. it's lightweight  and easy to use. If you want to vacuum your steps or furniture it come with attachments to do that.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,21-Jun-19,Booboo27,Great movement, I got this a few weeks ago. It’s so great where I can take it compared to my bigger vacuums. The charge holds well if you have it on the correct power. Great for getting under the couch where the dog hair hides
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,20-Jun-19,crees,Great for hardwood floors," I have been a big fan of stick vacuums for a while. They just make it so much easier to vacuum on the regular. I have had a vacuum for a while that I love but wasn't great with our hardwoord floors. This vacuum has the perfect attachment for hardwoods! I am loving it for that!
But, it takes up a lot more space than my previous vacuum. And it has so many attachments it was overwhelming to put together and just looks ""bigger"" in storage than I would like. It's great to have so many attachments but I would probably trade a few back to get a smaller footprint."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,20-Jun-19,drewdrewatx,Sleek and functional," This vacuum is absolutely fantastic! It is slim, sleek, and just so easy to use. It cleans many nooks and crannies and is very lightweight. We have a dog that sheds a lot, and this vacuum is so perfect to keep our house clean."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,20-Jun-19,Dm801,Sleek and stylish with a great turbo button, As a cat owner I'm always looking for better ways to pick up fur off basically everything. I was excited to try this vacuum cleaner out and see how well it worked. A very nice feature is that it comes with two battery packs so you can be charging one while vacuuming with the other. There is a turbo button which increases suction significantly and helps pick up in hard to reach places. Very useful but it does drain the battery quickly.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,19-Jun-19,Bippypipd,Love it, I'm so in love with this vacuum. It is very portable but has tremendous suction too. It is so much faster than using a broom to sweep my hardwood floors and does a better job. The width of the head is just the right width for my stairs as well. The attachments are easy to switch out and the extra battery will ensure I can do the whole house without waiting for a recharge. Only downside is the dirt bucket is quite small. I have to  empty it several times as I clean my whole house.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,19-Jun-19,Atxhc,This vacuum has changed my life, Cordless vacuums have changed my life. This is the first one I have owned and I absolutely love it. It's light and powerful. I have small children so I have lots of messes to clean up during the day. This handles large and small jobs effortlessly. It's so nice not to have to mess with the cord. The kids love the vacuum as well and love using it (added bonus)! You won't be disappointed with this vacuum. The only thing I would change is having an additional setting for hardwood flooring.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,1,18-Jun-19,Anonymous,Poor Quality than expected," I bought this vacuum a week ago and have used for two or three times for carpet cleaning.  As showing on the attached picture, the rubber and bursh part from the bottom of brush came out from the body."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,18-Jun-19,Bibi Mac,Excellent Vacuum," After 2 weeks of using the LG Cord Zero:
Pros:  
Quality built excellent even weight distribution design overall.
Great looking design
Stand is a plus since I don’t like mounting anything on the wall
It’s Powerful with all the attachments (alternating attachment).
Battery life also a plus average use was over 38 minutes each straight with standard, plus quick release for the battery makes switching and ease.
Floor Nozzle – great for Marble floors and Hardwood can move around furniture and even slide under a couch at ease.
Punch Nozzle – Great for high traffic area rugs to loosen up dust and dirt.
Carpet Nozzle – Excellent with lots of power for picking up all type of debris.
Controls are very easy to use 
(Haven’t wash the filters yet but this is definitely a plus)
Easy manual and self-explanatory maintenance 
Cons:
With all the attachments included there should be a place to store everything in the stand."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,18-Jun-19,Dimpy,Amazing!!," Vacuuming has never been so much fun before. I simply love this vacuum cleaner. It being cordless makes my life much more easy. I always hated maneuvering around the card of the vacuum cleaner. The dual battery packs are a great feature. I don't have to worry about battery running out and waiting for it to be charged again. The storage of the vacuum cleaner is also amazing. I like that D attachments have a slot on the stand as well. They are not lying around. The charging station and the stand are nicely stored in my closet where the plot point connected for charging. I wish on this model as well they would have provided a hook on the stand for the nozzle to be stored away.
 In terms of cleaning this vacuum cleaner does a decent job.  I rarely use the broom now. It is so easy to maneuver. I just wished it had a small brush on the sides to get to the corners easily. All in all it is totally worth the money and I hope it lasts for years to come."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,18-Jun-19,WattsFam,Perfect!," I can not begin to say how much I love this vacuum.   I spent tons a few years ago on a “pet machine” that weighs a ton, doesn’t work as well as this stick, and ironically, makes the dog super duper angry.  

This is a powerhouse in a lightweight stick.  I love that I can mount it or place it in its weighted stand.  The attachments are cool.  

I vacuumed (with my heavy vacuum) under my desk, the dog’s safe place.   Then I took the LG to it.   it picked up so much more.  I shudder to think what we’ve been breathing for all these years. 

It’s easy to assemble, charges quickly and has the attachments I need to get the job done.  

And the kicker?  It’s so quiet the dog doesn’t even bat an eyelash.  

I’m very happy and I’m sure I’ll stop showing guests how well it works any day now."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,18-Jun-19,steward1990,Works well, I’m using this vacuum in my classroom. It works well for the bare floor and the rug. The attachments are nice for getting the corners and edges. The only criticism I have is that I wish the stand had more weight. I can not attach it to the wall and more weight would help keep it in place better.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,17-Jun-19,Jkc83,Making mom life a little easier," This might be long review but it will be worth the read!
Brief overview-
Pros- great for multi surface floors, super easy to use, great attachments, lightweight, good suction
Cons- battery life isn't the best, storage for attachments, switching out attachments between surfaces 

I've had this vacuum for a couple weeks and I'm obsessed. I'm a first time mom to a little boy who just turned one. Life is busy and messy! We also have 2 small dogs so needless to say, I need all the help I can get when it comes to cleaning. This vacuum makes life so much easier!

I've been using this mainly downstairs where I have several rugs on top of tile floors. It has been wonderful to clean up messes in the kitchen, dog hair off the couch, and dust bunnies from all the baseboards and corners. The vacuum has great suction on all surfaces. I really like the turbo button. Gives it a nice little boost to really suck all the nasty stuff up. The attachments click in and out easily but you do have to switch between carpeted and hard surfaces. I also love the little attachment for cleaning blankets and sheets. Great for dog hair. It doesnt suck up the whole thing and freeze the vacuum. 

The vacuum is super lightweight and is easy to use with both hands. The stick part is extendable so that it will work for people of various heights. I love using this to clean out my car. I just stick the attachments directly on the handle part so it's small and compact and the best part is theres no cord! It really makes it ideal to clean your car or other things outside the home. Its very portable and lightweight. 

I love using it in the kitchen and dining room under the tables and chairs. So much easier than a regular upright vacuum. Gets in small places easily. I really like getting this out instead of our upright vacuum because I dont have to mess with a cord and it's just so much easier. 

It can be mounted on the wall. This will be my plan once I find an ideal place I want it. Its easy to place on the stand and charge it. The attachments fit on the stand but I am left with no spot for the blanket/sheet roller attachment. I wish there was one more spot to hang that one. 

Battery life isnt great but it does have a backup battery so with both batteries, I can get most of the house done. But honestly I dont usually vacuum my whole house at once. I'll do downstairs one time and upstairs the next. So the battery works for the amount of time I use it. 

Upstairs we have carpet. We also have carpeted stairs. This is great on our stairs. Makes it so easy to clean. It does well on the carpet too. Easy to get around the furniture and under the bed. It fits really well under everything. Nice slim profile. 

Overall, this vacuum has been amazing. I really enjoy getting it out and vacuuming. So much easier than lugging the upright vacuum and plugging it in, moving the cord everywhere, and lugging it up and down the stairs. It works great and sucks up everything in its path. Baseboards, carpets, tile, rugs, vehicles, sheets, furniture....what more can you ask for?! If you want to save time and a little bit of sanity, do yourself a favor and get this vacuum!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,17-Jun-19,jkarpy12,BEST YET," This cordless vacuum makes vacuuming the stairs especially a breeze and do not have to worry about constantly re-plugging in. Easy to assemble, suction is good on this vacuum, and it’s easy to use and empty the contents.I honestly never thought I would like a cordless vacuum and assumed it wouldn't pick up like a corded vacuum until this one.  It is unbelievably convenient to be able to use this light weight vacuum throughout the house. Multiple attachments allows you to change between the floor type. Battery life is excellent, I have not had an issue yet. The mount is great to store away in a closet and to grab and go. I do not have anything bad to say about this vacuuming and I have used this already 10 times within my whole house. Highly recommend. This would be a great gift!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,17-Jun-19,jsk67,BEST VACUUM," I have been using this vacuum for over a week now, and I can honestly say I really love this vacuum. I love that it comes with an extra battery. The battery life seems pretty decent plus having the extra one makes it awesome.The LG Cord Zero stick vacuum is my new favorite household item because it is light weight! (that is key for me with 3 floors to carry this around) It included a generous number of attachments and the cordless feature is a bonus (no longer lugging or tripping over a cord). This vacuum is fairly quiet compared to most vacuums and does a great job! Also, I may add, I LOVE that it has a wall mount and I can hide this away in a closet without taking up too much room.I would highly recommend for purchase!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,17-Jun-19,scottpk,Works really well!, We got this a few weeks ago and have been very impressed so far!  The multiple attachements come in handy when working on different jobs.  It's also great to be able to use the vacuum without the extension to clean things like the car or furniture.  The varied levels of power are nice as well and the two batteries that come with it have been helpful when using for an extended period of time.  It has also been great to have a cordless vacuum to clean small areas.  Overall we have been very impressed with this and have been using it much more that I had thought we would.  I would definitely recommend this for its ease of use and for the great job it does!
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,15-Jun-19,Jmok_austin,So convenient!, I love this vacuum! It's very lightweight and easy to use. It has a stand up base so we keep it in the corner. It's extremely handy to have easy access to it because of all the dog hair we have. I found this very powerful and it easily picked up the dog hair and dirt from my floors. On carpet it was a little hard to use pushing forward. Once I pulled instead it was fine. One thing to note is when you are ready to empty the canister make sure you read the instructions. There is a piece you have to unscrew with one of the attachments before you can fully empty it.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,15-Jun-19,Julia515,Great vacuum," This vacuum is so nice! It has two great options for storage and is very convenient to use. We have two dogs and it picks up hair great! It lasts long enough to get all our spaces clean, no problem. it’s light enough to use on high spaces too."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,14-Jun-19,Kristoo12,Amazing Vacuum," This is the best vacuum I've ever used. I have purchased other high end vacuums in the past and the quality and strength of this product can't be compared. The hand held option has power and is easy to maneuver. It is easy to change out attachments and the quality of the vacuum does not lessen with different attachments. I like how you don't have to hold the power button to vacuum, and the suction power is very strong. I also like the different options for different floor types. There are a lot of pieces and the set up may seem daunting when opening the box for the first time, but once you have your head wrapped around all the different attachments it makes sense. The noise level is fairly quiet, too. It isn't deafening but still does the job. There is one attachment piece where the brush didn't get glued all the way, but a little super glue will fix it and it is not a deal breaker for me. I love this vacuum and don't mind cleaning my house anymore!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,14-Jun-19,Map520,Awesome!!," Our new favorite!!! Makes vacuuming the stairs especially a breeze. Easy to assemble, charge lasts for a fairly long time, enough to vacuum a 3000 sq ft home. Comes with a spare battery too. Must mention that it’s lightweight too."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,14-Jun-19,fuel1325,Love it!," I really love this vacuum. I love that it comes with an extra battery. The battery life seems pretty decent plus having the extra one makes it awesome. I like that you have the option of turning up the suction power even though it cost more battery life. The only thing I wish is that it came with the ability to have a power plug connected if you wanted it to last longer, however so far I've never needed it to last longer than the job I've had to do. It works great for stairs and has plenty of battery life to vacuum them all and then some.  (It also works great for sucking up flies.)"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,14-Jun-19,ElGuapo77,This light weight vacuum lets me share the chores!," This is a great little vacuum that is perfect for the house for every day use and smaller chores.  With no cords and being so light, the younger kids use it to clean up messes and do normal chores.  This vacuum comes with a separate battery, but I haven’t used it yet.  The different attachments work well.  The floor attachment works well too.

Suction is good on this vacuum, and it’s easy to use and empty the contents.

One thing is that putting the stand together, make sure you have the order correct before snapping the people in place- because I don’t know how to separate them to add the attachment holder.

Another thing the instructions are a little light on what each attachment does, but it can be figured out."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,13-Jun-19,mom1234,Lightweight Vacuum that gets the job done," This vacuum is well worth the investment.  Unlike the regular vacuum it isn’t clunky or difficult to maneuver.  It didn’t hurt my wrists, arms or back when used on the rugs or the hardwood floors.  It has enough adaptors so that I could go into all the little crevices and corners of my home.  Unlike the hand-held vacuums, it is powerful enough to pick up all the pet hair from my furniture and dust from the blinds.  I would recommend this vacuum highly."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,13-Jun-19,Pmyers1016,Powerful, I have a wood floor with a few area rugs. This powerful cordless vacuum does the trick. It has attachments for both bare floors and carpets.  Its adaptable from a hand held to full length with the tube extension. Was easy to put together.  The only thing i scratched my head on was which attachment went to carpet and which went to floor. Black & white pictures didnt do them justice.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,13-Jun-19,Gem S,Game changer!," This LG vacuum is the perfect addition to any home! Its cordless versatility makes housekeeping more manageable and a little more fun at the same time! The days of fighting with the cord or having the vacuum turn off because I've gone too far and pulled it from the wall are over! I love that it's lightweight, very quiet, and has multiple attachments to suit my cleaning needs (carpet, floor, furniture, corners etc). And, I can't wait to use the handheld feature to clean my car! Although I adore this LG product, I didn't find an attachment that picked up cat hair off fabric furniture very well, and the battery seemed to drain pretty quickly when using turbo mode for increased suctioning. Luckily, there's a backup battery that easily charges in the auxilliary charging station, so switching them out is a breeze! All in all, this product is a true game changer in cleaning!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,12-Jun-19,Clb73,My favorite vacuum!," I'm so happy with the convenience and suction of this vacuum. I honestly never thought I would like a cordless vacuum and assumed it wouldn't pick up like a corded vacuum. Wow, I was wrong! It picks up dirt I didn't even see, it's lightweight, easy to use, gets in all the crevices and is super easy to empty. I love this cleaning tool and all the attachments and the stand. I recommend this to everyone!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,12-Jun-19,wogsll34,Most amazing vacuum ever!," The LG Cord Zero stick vacuum is my new favorite household item! When you open the box, it's initially a little overwhelming as there seems to be alot of pieces.  I promise it was super easy to setup, and took me maybe 5 minutes.  The vacuum comes with a multitude of attachments for every surface you could want to clean, and this is why it seemed to be so much.  It is lightweight to use, making it very easy to use the attachments.  It is cordless, which makes cleaning so much easier, not having to ensure you have enough cord to get around the room.  There is also a really neat stand, which you can use, or you can mount the charging station to a wall or you can use the compact storage design. This holds the attachments as well as charges the battery. The filters and cycle system are really easy to wash and the canister is simple and clean to empty.  The handle telescopes and is appropriate height for both my husband and I and will be comfortable for people of all heights to use.  I was amazed at how much dog fur and dirt this vacuum picked up after I had just vacuumed and had my carpeting cleaned the day prior to receiving.  The buttons are easy to use, there is on and off and then selecting powers levels or turbo mode.  It was easy to change the mode while holding the vacuum.  The Power Punch attachment is one of my favorite attachments as it vibrates and helps lift away hidden dust.  I used this on our mattresses and couch and it really seemed to lift additional dust away. The batteries lasted us close to 40 minutes, but much less when using the turbo mode.  The vacuum includes 2 batteries, so you can always have one ready to go, which I LOVE!  This vacuum is also quiet where I feel like I can vacuum when my kids are napping and not worry about waking them.  I really really love this product and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a high quality vacuum that really works! So easy to use and the best vacuum I've ever owned."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,12-Jun-19,fred33,Great vacuum," This is an awesome cordless vacuum. It's easy to use and transport throughout the house without dealing with any cords. It doesn't hold a ton of debris which is unfortunate since we have a lot of dog hair, but aside from emptying it fairly often it works great."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,12-Jun-19,jillsy19,AMAZING!, This is such a lightweight and powerful machine. I love that it has such a small footprint when charging. It's not loud and it easier to maneuver. I keep it on normal mode because it looses power a little quicker in turbo mode but still allows me to clean quickly and efficiently.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,11-Jun-19,CEC1920,Great Vacuum," This is an awesome vacuum. I initially had concerns with the suction / cleaning ability of this vacuum, but I was pleasantly surprised that my worry was in vein!  The power of the suction was also on my mind but all concern faded after my first use, I was truly shocked to see all of the things this vacuum cleaned up that my prior vacuum had not captured!!  We have a lot of wood floors in our home so the ability to switch the attachments and use on different floor types is phenomenal!  It is a very light weight, easy to handle / maneuver."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,11-Jun-19,vacguy44,This thing SUCKS," This thing sucks in a good way!  It even has a turbo boost setting when you need it to suck even more.  The extra battery, attachments and stand are very nice to have and I've not had any issued with it so far."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,11-Jun-19,krisseyv92,I love vacuuming now!," I have never liked vacuuming because I have always lived in a two story space and hate having to find a space for a chord and move the chord between rooms when I am vacuuming. Now that we have this cordless vacuum, I am vacuuming more than I ever have! It is unbelievably convenient to be able to use this light weight vacuum throughout the house. I can easily vacuum our entire house now within 15 minutes! I have never had an issue with the battery life. It is easy to clean and charge. The vacuum works great on our hard wood floors and carpeted areas. Overall extremely happy with this vacuum."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,11-Jun-19,zerohalo100,"It sucks, but in the best way possible!"," This is a seriously amazing vacuum. I was skeptical at first because it's so small; I figured there was no way it could have a motor strong enough to be effective. I was big-time wrong. We have a larger vacuum at home that's done a reasonably good job over the years, but when we used this little guy to clean the same carpets it pulled up so much more gunk! We had to empty it 3 times before it finally stopped pulling much up.

It also comes with just a ton of attachments and options. I never had a vacuum that let me decide how much sucking force it would use. And because it's so light with all those attachment options we were able to clean things we couldn't before. Nooks and crannies in my car, and it cleaned my stairs better than I've ever seen."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,11-Jun-19,MHATX,Best cordless vacuum I have ever owned!," A vacuum first and foremost needs to have power to pick up dirt, and this one definitely does. Being cordless, it is very convenient to move around the house without tripping on or vacuuming over the cord. It also makes it easy to take into the garage to vacuum out the car. Because we mostly have hard floors and can run the vacuum on normal power, one battery is good enough to clean the house. However, having two is a nice bonus. I didn’t want to have to drill into the wall to hang up a charger, so I am really glad LG included a stand. It included a generous number of attachments, so it is good for hardwood floors and carpet, as well as for getting in tighter spots and cleaning furniture. It is not too heavy and is comfortable to hold."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,11-Jun-19,Shellysig,Amazing clean!, I love this vacuum!  It is lightweight and easy to handle yet so powerful.  Its compact which makes it easy to do the stairs and its extension allows me to get the ceiling and tops of windows easily.  I first tried this out on a previously vacuumed floor and was blown away by the hidden dirt that this picked up from my carpet!  Definitely will make a difference with our allergies!  The charging station can either hang or sit on the floor.  It doesn't tip over and it is so easy to remove from the base.  It also houses an extra battery though I've cleaned my entire house on one fully charged battery.  So simple to use yet amazing technology!  I love the color as well.  It's like a shiny new car!
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,11-Jun-19,JRGH,Love!, Absolutely love this vacume.  Does and awesome job on my hardwood floors and also on my carpeting.   The color is really great and fun.  The vacume is also not overly loud which is nice. Just another great quality product from LG
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,10-Jun-19,teachnumluv,Handy sweeper!," This little sweeper is handy for small clean ups on carpet, smooth floors and furniture.  It's light weight and comes with two batteries.  The cordless feature is nice.  It's a bit short to be comfortable for long use, but works great for what I need it for.  Doesn't take up much room and looks nice!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,4,9-Jun-19,jerman2000,"Nice features, works well, very quiet."," This LG works very well and is extremely quiet for a vacuum.  I like the fact that you can dial in your power needs with a touch a button, but I will say, it will go through a fully charged battery very quickly on full ""turbo"" power.  That is probably the only major disappointment.  Having two batteries is really nice.  If you are using this on the regular setting, the power is still great and the battery lasts a sufficient amount of time.  It's also nice to have the option of the stand, rather than only being able to mount it to the wall.  However, it would be really nice to have a smaller mount that attached to the wall.  The stand by itself isn't very stable unless you attach the top to the wall.  It’s not very practical, but in a closet with power, it would be great.  If you looking to put it in a cramped utility room (like we did) it’s not very practical."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,9-Jun-19,Rossocal,Love the versatility," This is one of the best additions to my home appliance collection. The versatility and mobility allow me to clean places my Dyson won’t reach. The multiple attachments provide solutions for all areas of my house - hardwood, carpet, and stairs. The backup battery allows for 24/7 cleaning. Highly recommend."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,6-Jun-19,bonnielou56,Amazing, I have always complained about fighting with a cord while sweeping.  This is just what I was waiting for for years.  Its light weight and recharges on a stand or you can wall mount it.  COmes with 2 batteries to just keep on cleaning.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,6-Jun-19,kyhgomez35,LIGHT AND EASY TO USE, I LOVE MY LG STICK VACUUM! IT IS LIGHT AND EASY TO USE. I LIKE THE CHARGING STAND THAT CAME WITH IT! IT HOLDS THE EXTRA BATTERY PLUS THE ACTUAL VACUUM CANISTER WITH THE BATTERY IN IT ALSO SO BOTH BATTERIES ARE ALWAYS CHARGED AND READY TO GO. IT HAS A WALL MOUNT PIECE THAT YOU CAN USE WHICH I CHOSE TO JUST USE THE STAND AND IT WORKS PERFECT!
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,6-Jun-19,DrGWright,"LOVE this vacuum, but needs a few tweaks"," First of all, I am super impressed with this vacuum and its cleaning ability.  I currently also own an Oreck Halo that I use (or used to) several times a week.  I'll go through some pros and cons of this amazing product, as nothing is ever truly perfect.

Pros:
 - Doesn't seem like it has a lot of power, but it does!
 - Super quiet
 - Sleek
 - Slim
 - Lightweight
 - Washable filters
 - Easy to attach and detach accessories
 - Vacuums better than my Oreck Halo (I emptied so many canisters from the LG of what the Oreck didn't pick up.  I was amazed)
 - The hard floor and carpets feel cleaner
 - The pet attachment is amazing and gets hair off of furniture more than our separate pet handheld vacuum

Cons:
 - Very small canister (I have to empty this after each room, or sometimes twice per room)
 - Emptying the canister is awkward.  The opening of the canister should be on the other side, towards the back of the unit, for easier dumping.  If an accessory, wand, or anything is attached, it makes the unit heavier towards the front and harder to empty easily.
 - The ""finger rest"" in the handle hurts and is unnecessary.  
 - Sometimes it's difficult to completely empty the canister when stuff is stuck up towards the top of the filters.  I have to use something usually to dig it out."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,6-Jun-19,AmberK85,My Floors Have Never Looked Better.," Vacuuming was one of those undesirable chores that my family argued over constantly, until we were introduced to the LG CordZero stick vacuum. This vacuum is insanely cool. It is lightweight and easy to maneuver, yet surprisingly powerful. One pass over the nastiest mess is enough to clean it perfectly, seriously. The pipe is adjustable, so we can all make the vacuum cater to our individual height.  Even my seven year old gets his perfect sized vacuum, and it isn't too bulky and heavy that he gets too tired to finish the job. There is a turbo button that boosts the suction, but I haven't needed to use it once yet. It gets EVERYTHING up, even annoying pet hair, and dumping the cylinder that holds the dirt/mess is as easy as literally pushing a button. This vacuum had to have been designed by housewives (who were also technological geniuses), or at least someone who was focused on making sure it could handle any task. Plus, there is no cord to dance around, or limit where you can take the vacuum. It vacuums my car better than the giant machines at the car wash, and it is so flexible that it gets all the way under my furniture and cabinets. I am blown away by everything it can do. This machine is absolutely brilliant, and it makes my former (extremely expensive) vacuum look like an ancient, useless contraption. This vacuum is SO worth the investment. Your family will fight over who gets to play, I mean clean, with it. I'm trying to figure out how I can give it ten stars instead of five."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,6-Jun-19,bethjs,amazing vacuum," this vacuum is amazing.   i have had a Dyson also so able to compare against competitive brand. 

pros - stand that does not require mounting to the wall, lightweight, multiple attachments (so good for upholstery, cars, blinds, ceiling corners etc),  on/off button (Dyson has a touch release), multiple speeds, vacuum head swivels, great suction, can do entire 2 story house without battery dying.  multiple batteries - so if you don't charge or have a lot of cleaning will not run out of battery use, can charge both batteries at once.  stand is low and sits nicely off to the side.

this vacuum works just like a heavy vacuum. its lightweight portability makes it easy to do multiple floors quickly.   The canister is easy to empty - despite it being easy i tend to clean out in the garage to avoid any dirt getting out of the can.  it comes with an instruction quick guide for cleaning the vacuum itself.  this is easy to hang in laundry room which provides instructions and recommended timelines. it comes with an extra filter as well.  

this vacuum will easily replace all other machines you use as it is easy to use as a handheld for smaller areas (car) and larger areas (carpets/stairs).  no need to have both."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Jun-19,Chicksig,Excellent suction and longevity," This vacuum is great.  It is lightweight, and easy to lift and maneuver around on stairs.  It has an extension that is great to get ceilings and tops of windows and behind furniture.  This vacuum all the attachments needed to clean a variety of household messes.  The vacuum is easy to charge and has an extra battery on the charger ready to swap out when needed.  Charger can be hung on the wall or can be portable with its weighted base,and it’s simple to charge and lift off the charger.  The charge has held up long enough to vacuum our entire house.  It’s kept on the charger so it’s always ready to use."
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Jun-19,Gina C,Love it!, It is the best vacuum I have ever had.  It is so light weight and very easy to change from hardwood or tile to carpet.  It has great suction and is so portable that it is very easy to store.  I love the fact it has two batteries so they are always charged.  It is the best vacuum on the market.  I love it.
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,5-Jun-19,Cocoa80,SUPERB VACUUM," This LG Cord Zero vacuum is the truth I love using it every day sometimes three times a day lu t really brings power in a small and lightweight packages and it never disappoints I'm able to not only vacuum my carpet but also my hard flooring and it does a superb job and sucking up all the crumbs and what nots the power in the sucking had me wondering why I ever used any other vacuum on the market it showed me the difference..It comes with all the attachments you need to do other areas like window seals,baseboards, curtains drapes or blinds it's the perfect tool for every home..Go Get You One!"
homedepot,LG A907GMS,5,4-Jun-19,picture crazy momma,awesome!," I have absolutely nothing bad to say. It is a great cordless vacuum. Over the years, we've had 4 cordless vacuums. 1 was cheap garbage, 1 was just terrible, 1 was a dyson and it was ok, but this one... hands down the best. First, the package and assembly is nicely done. Second, the extras are great. Spare battery and filter. Plenty of attachments also. The battery life is great. I have yet to need to switch batteries while using it. My 8 year old uses it most times. So it is great for him. It works on carpet! This is a huge plus. We love it for the stairs. Also it has multiple speeds and it is much more quite than you'd expect. GREAT VACUUM!!!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,26-Oct-22,Anonymous,Best vacuum ever,This vacuum is amazing. Not only does it work well on carpet but it also does great on hardwood floors. It’s so much easier than sweeping and the Kompressor helps to compress the dirt so you don’t have to worry about emptying the tank as much
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,2,24-Oct-22,Anonymous,Cord zero review,We bought our Cord Zero and very shortly after we got it it malfunctioned. We sent it for repair it came back and a very short time later the same malfunction happened again .it is currently in for repair again. I paid way too much for this to have these problems.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,21-Oct-22,GarySparky,LG Cordless Vacuum,"So far, it has been excellent.
Lightweight, picks up well and the trash reservoir is easy to clean."

homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,11-Oct-22,Cissie123,LOVE IT !!,"I bought this cordless vacuum a couple of months ago. I love how it's always charged and ready to go. Now, I can't live without it!  From carpet to floors, it does an excellent job of cleaning because of awesome suction. LG products are the best!!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,11-Oct-22,Solidus07,Amazing vacuum,"My wife and I started using this product a month ago, it’s being incredible, it cleans deep, is easy to use and the turbo mode really helps with the difficult spots"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,6-Oct-22,Anonymous,Great lightweight vacuum for all needs,When we got this vacuum we were concerned that something so small could perform for all our needs.  After using it for a while we fell in love with it.  We can put the beater brush on the hand unit and easily do the stairs or sweep out the car.  We can pick up spilled dry cereal and dump the canister right into the trash.  From a suction perspective having 3 levels of suction and two batteries is a miracle.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,4-Oct-22,Lola1985,Best invention ever!,"My best friend and I started a cleaning business 6 months ago. After much research, we decided on the LG (aka “Lola”..haha). Lola has been worth every penny we spent. We will highly recommend LG to family and friends every chance we get. Thank you!!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,20-Sep-22,ChetanP,PRODUCT NUMBER: A925KSM," Its a good vacuum. Overall very easy to use and very compatible. I am glad to have that 10 years of motor warranty which makes me feel safe to buy this product at this cost. Though this one is not that costly compared to other similar products.

Improvements: its been only few weeks that I have used, but i guess the suction power can be improved. Also the extension it comes with is for all floors which has rotating brush. I would suggest to either have separate extension for both carpet and hard floor or a mechanism to turn of the brush rotating.

Lastly its about the unique features of kompressor technology which is very good. One improvement that can be made is the bin is detachable so that it becomes even easy to dump the trash. But this is only suggestion. I am completely ok with what they currently have."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,17-Sep-22,Anonymous,Love this vacuum!,"We bought this vacuum a few weeks ago and absolutely love it! It works well on multiple surfaces, which is PERFECT!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,11-Sep-22,BobD31,Extremely easy to use!,"I bought this vac recently and have only used it a few times. But it is exceptionally easy and convenient to use. The weight and adjustable height are perfect as is the maneuverability. It picks up a surprising amount of dust and dirt—I've been surprised at how much has collected in the small canister each time I've used it. It's easy to empty and clean, and it stores nicely on the stand. I haven't used it long enough in one setting to lower the battery indicating bars below full charge. I bought this unit in part because I wanted something light and easy to use, and so far I'm very pleased with this."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,5-Sep-22,Emmy and Nabi,very worthy,"I bought this a month ago, and have used 4 times. So far, no concerns, and all seem to be excellent. The weight is also lighter than I thought."

homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,2-Sep-22,everclear2,Very satisfied,I have always been skeptical about purchasing a battery powered stick vacuum. I should of purchased one earlier. The ease of just grabbing it and vacuuming without any cords in the way and the lightweight makes it easy moving it around. I love the extra battery being able to charge while using the vacuum. Overall very satisfied with purchase.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,31-Aug-22,Phillip00,What an amazing vacuum!!!,This is the best vacuum that I have ever owned. So easy to use. Great sucking power. Easy to empty. Great battery life. Can’t be happier.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,21-Aug-22,Anonymous,Love the freedom,I have used it for about a month and I love the features and double battery.  I have a small retirement home and I haven’t gotten through one battery yet!
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,16-Aug-22,Bobo 8542,Convenient mobile,Better then sliced bread .  No dragging out an aircraft carrier vacuum. Two batteries always ready to go
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,10-Aug-22,D Aceman,GREAT Vaccum,I bought this to replace another stick vacuum and I'm so glad I did. The vacuum is very powerful and with the extra battery doing the entire house is absolutely no problem.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,6-Aug-22,Anna23,Makes vacuuming a breeze," I have never liked vacuuming, but this LG Cordless Vacuum has changed my outlook on cleaning.  It is light, quiet and easy to use.  I can't believe I am saying this but a pleasure to use."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,3-Aug-22,Kathleen43,Light weight and powerful," I have had my LG CordZero for a couple of months.  I use it ever morning to vacuum my wood floors and my kitchen tiles.  It does a fantastic job.  It is so light weight which is what I need because of a back problem.  I love the docking station, and I also love the fact that I didn't have to attach it to a wall.  It is free standing and very sturdy.  The battery is long lasting.  Even though I haven't had to use the backup battery, the fact that it is always ready should I need it is a major plus.  The only thing that would make this vacuum better for me would be that I would be able to use it on my area rugs and wall-to-wall carpet.  The pile is just too dense to be able to easily push it."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,28-Jul-22,Stephanie,Love this vacuum,Did the bundle with the laundry unit and am so glad I did! This is a great vacuum! I have a heavy shedding dog and this vacuum keeps up. The compacting unit is such an awesome feature and convenient for less trips to the garbage can to clean it out.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,4,28-Jul-22,Cooper S,"Loving my new vacuum, but will it last?"," So far, so good with my new LG Stick vacuum.  I bought this vacuum about three weeks ago.  I'm amazed at the amount of dog hair the vacuum gets off my hardwood floors and area rugs.  So nice to have a lightweight vacuum that does the job and is easy on my back.  Only time will tell whether this vacuum will hold up to the wear and tear of having a dog that sheds constantly (which is why I only rated the vacuum 4 stars instead of 5 stars).  Having two batteries is a definite plus as I almost always use the Turbo feature of the vacuum to get up pet hair.  I do wish the vacuum came with a floor brush and a small sofa brush.  The only downside at this point is that I vacuum a lot more than I used to vacuum!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,4,22-Jul-22,Hard to clean seal,Nice sweeper------BUT, I like the battery life.  It needs a light and the hard floor nozzle is loud and it sounds like it is hard on my floors.  I've noticed scuffing where I have swept cat litter.  Mine also had a sour smell even though I clean filters regularly.  Emptying is not bad except getting the dirt around the seals in the bottom is difficult
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,12-Jul-22,User,First cordless vacuum cleaner,"So far, it has worked well.  I like not having to manage the cord while cleaning and it definitely speeds up the process.  The only weakness in the machine that I've seen so far is the grip.  The grip separates my forefinger from the middle finger and actually causes some irritation on both of those fingers.  Fortunately, vacuuming the entire house doesn't take very long (about 1800 sq ft).  I do use it in the garage as well.  It has no problem with sucking up dead crickets.

I really like the charging stand.  It is set up in the laundry room and takes up minimal space."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,11-Jul-22,Miss09,Easy Cleaning," I bought this vacuum weeks ago, and so far it does its job in no time. No more hassle with cords or being heavy to move around. All around easy clean up with emptying debris, and cleaning the filters."

homedepot,LG A927KVMS,2,29-May-22,mmus88,Doesn't live up to expectations," This model only works well for light, everyday vacuuming. I purchased it expecting it to be effective on pet hair. If there is any accumulation of pet hair (more than light shedding from 1-2 days), it repeatedly clogs and turns off. You have to stop and clean out the blockage, then start again. (Note that I only have 1 dog, and the shedding is not excessive.) It is lightweight, cordless, and the freestanding docking station are all excellent features - and it works well for daily, light vacuuming. However, it is useless for heavy duty cleaning. It is definitely not worth the high price."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,10-May-22,Fat1ma,Excellent.," Bought this about six weeks ago, and it was the best purchase done."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,8-May-22,lgcordzero,Lightweight and easy to use,"I love, love, love this LG Cord Zero Kompressor vacuum. I told my hubby I hated our old vacuum cleaner because it was too heavy -- despite being advertised as lightweight -- and it was a pain dragging the cord around. (Husbands always say vacuuming is the one chore they like to do but then they never do it.) Anyway, to his credit, he researched and found the LG Cord Zero and it is a dream come true. It is intuitively designed so it is easy to use; it is TRULY lightweight, maneuvers easily, has great suction, the charging stand was easy to place, emptying the dirt trap is easy. I just love everything about it. Kudos to the design team. I finally have a vacuum that gets used regularly. I read other reviews where people had maintenance issues but no problems so far with ours. (We have had it for several months now -- maybe longer.)"

It works and kudos! it comes with 2 batteries. Now, for some reason my batteries both died- won't recharge but I called LG and they are sending new batteries without a hassle. As it should be. Now, what I hate about this unit is the upholstery ""brush"", It's not a brush at all. Its a rubber thing with bumps. Doesn't work. What I love: the push-down lever in the dirt tank. Love this! So, thumbs down on the upholstery brush, thumbs up on the dirt tank lever. Overall, before the batteries would not charge it seemed to work fine."

Helps touch up the carpet when the cat rolls around and leaves fur everywhere. I love that it extends and comes with an extra battery. The floor stand is also great and many more expensive vacs don’t come with one (just a well mount). For the price though, I’d love to see it come with more accessories. 

Almost forgot, love how easy it is to clean. Easy to take the dust out of the cup, easy to replace the filter and easy to clean out stuck fur thanks to a push down lever that helps clear out the dust cup."

The Kompressor works great for my multi-pet household! The batteries last a long time and it can get my floors done without having to wait to charge a battery. The only negative is emptying the dust cup is very messy! I have been using bagless vacuums for a very long time and this is the messiest one I have ever dealt with. The hole in the middle holds on to the dust requiring me to tilt it this way and that to get all the dust out. Once I think it is empty, I go to close the cup and a bunch of dust and dirt still falls all over my hand."

I love it.  I love having no cord to plug/unplug or trip over.  I like that it's lightweight and has a small cleaner head to go under dressers and beds.  It's so easy to use and to empty the canister when it fills up.  Great suction too.

Very powerful...when I first got it, I used it immediately after vacuuming with my old model. I filled the canister TWICE with dirt that the old one missed.
Our old one was a top of the line floor model, expensive but very reliable and, we thought, doing a really good job...

Cons: Every time you put this on the charger you have to lower the wand.

homedepot,LG A927KVMS,1,21-Feb-22,CORK64,SUCTION IS POOR,I JUST BOUGHT THIS LESS THAN 3 MONTHS AGO AND IT IS NOT WORKING.  IT BEEPS TO ALERT YOU TO A CLOG BUT YOU CAN'T UNCLOG IT AS THE CLOG IS ABOVE A BROKEN SEAL
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,15-Feb-22,Dianne49,"Quality, Quality, Quality!"," I've been a Dyson owner for several years, but LG took me away from all that.  This machine outperforms the Dyson in every way.  I especially like the on/off switch rather than having to press a trigger to keep the motor running.  It is super-quiet and very powerful.  I really like the telescoping wand and the extra battery.  Thanks LG!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,1,12-Feb-22,Nothappy,no,"batteries don't last. I had this sweeper for about a week, and both batteries stopped holding a charge."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,12-Feb-22,Heidi W,Light and powerful," I've had my LG vacuum for about 2 months now and am really loving it.  I have two ragdoll cats so I use my vac multiple times a day. I love the power button, the compressor, and most of all the charging stand.  It is so convenient.  This thing really picks up the cat hair!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,5-Feb-22,DavyR,Light & Powerful: Makes Vacuuming a Breeze!," I was initially impressed by the light weight and maneuverability, and that thought it would be perfect for stairs and tight places. 
What I discovered was that it is as powerful as my heavy ‘animal’ vacuum so it is great for everything.  Because it is cordless, it is easy to get to places that I wouldn’t often clean, and I can easily empty it into the trash bin outside."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,1-Feb-22,Baffin Bay Bum,Powerful and quiet, This is a very good and efficient vacuum.  We have 3 pets and it picks up their hair well.  I also like the fact that it's cordless and stores easily in the corner or the room.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,31-Jan-22,Retired Eddie,Excellent stic vacuum," This vacuum saves quite a bit of time that used to be wasted using a ""lobby"" broom and dustpan set.  It makes short work of picking up kitty litter, dust bunnies and other things from tile and hardwood floors.  It's easy to empty out the collection bin and to switch out the batteries when one runs a bit low (two rechargeable batteries are supplied)."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,8-Jan-22,Fylo,Leading Choice," Been through a host of stick vacs over years, my LG is best so far."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,1-Jan-22,Sher G,Great vac, Absolutely love this vacuum. It is so light and easy to use. Works great on dog hair. The only negative thing I can say is the battery runs out quicker than I need it to…I have a huge area to vacuum. But the positive is it came with 2 batteries.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,7-Oct-21,Helen1996,Great Vacuum, I bought this few weeks ago. It was easy to assemble and use. Great performance!
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,4,28-Sep-21,OHgurl,Overall good, I bought it less than a month ago and the string at bottom by rollers came off and got stuck in rollers stopping the suction..Other than that disappointment the suction is powerful. Just hope it lasts !
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,2,18-Sep-21,Lynnerae,Charging issue," My unit does not always keep it's charge, but it's keep in it's charging station always when not in use.  The charging lights in my manual say that they stay on after it's fully charged, but they only stay on a short time and then go off.  I was told it may be an issue with the batteries, so they sent me one new battery about 2 weeks ago - the unit has two batteries.  I have used the new battery and the lights still do not stay on.  Not happy with the power I get from the unit, and if I push the turbo button the unit runs out of power really fast.  I know I would not be able to vacuum for the 120 minutes you claim  even with the regular power.  I purchased the unit December 14th and was in Florida for 5 months, so have only used it for 5 months."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,17-Sep-21,Tamarak,Love the 2 batteries," We have had 3 Dyson vacuums over the years and they have all been great.  Decided to try the LG as we have several LG appliances and have always been happy with them.  I love the fact that the LG vacuum has 2 rechargeable and inter changeable batteries.  I like to use the turbo power as we have lots of dog hair and I am able to use it longer with the LG, though it does run out of power rather quickly. Overall I am very happy with my LG cord zero stick vacuum."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,4-Sep-21,ProfeJim,Amazing cordless vacuum!," I couldn't be happier with my purchase of this LG Cordless Vacuum! With all its innovative features, power, and performance, I feel I have made the best decision in chosing an LG. I look forward to many years of trouble free operation and superior cleaning performance."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,31-Aug-21,Hippity Hoppity,Great and compact," This is a great product, has made life just that much easier, grab it and go. Very versatile and better suction than I expected from a cordless."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,23-Aug-21,lee215,Quiet but powerful," I always Dyson's products but I tried to use LG this time and my I'm loving this vacuum.
It is very quiet but powerful suction especially came with 2 batteries so I can clean the whole house. My wife also loves this product because she doesn't have to hold the some kind of trigger while she vacuuming. It was nice decision to try out LG vacuum."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,19-Aug-21,Heather cleans,Saves me so much time!," This vacuum has saved me so much time. 
I use it to do my commercial office cleaning. No more running around looking for plugs and using extension cords that get caught under everything. It has a very long run time. I’ve cleaned 3,000 sq ft homes and the battery was still going strong. Also, lightest vacuum I’ve ever used."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,19-Aug-21,Vacuum Queen,Cordless Bliss," I live with Mr. Gadget, a husband who loves all things electronic.  Therefore finding an empty outlet to plug into is like finding your cat when it's time to go to the vet. When I do find an outlet I usually have to move furniture, unplug a device that is surely needed in his opinion, remember to plug that device in again when I'm done, and it seems I always need 2 more feet of cord to finish vacuuming the room I'm  vacuuming. With the LG cordless vac my life got 100% easier. No cord to get tangled up or stuck under furniture legs.  And no trying to find a usable outlet. I just lift the vac from the sturdy stand and start vacuuming. It's lightweight, has strong suction, and maneuvers easily in and around furniture. Easily slips under beds and sofas and the batteries last a long time. When I used to grab a broom to clean up a small mess, I now just grab my cordless and zoom its done. I find i can get the job done faster and find myself vacuuming more often because it's easier than dragging out the old vacuum. Great time saver."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,18-Aug-21,Fred56,Great Features," I've owned the A9 Compressor about 2 moths and am very satisfied with the product! I spent over a month looking at different brands of cordless stick vacs and decided on the LG A9 because of the advertised runtime, the fact it comes with a stand that can charge both the vac and second battery at the same time, and I wouldn't have to find a place to hang it on the wall. I have a 1500 sq. ft. home with more carpet than hard floors, and I can vacuum the entire house with the 2 batteries fully charged. Two rather unique features that surprised me by how much I like them are the compressor and the adjustable wand length. The compressor really allows for longer time between emptying the dirt bin, and by adjusting the wand shorter, it makes getting into tight places like closets, much easier. Also I like how it's easy to disassemble for cleaning. 
Overall it seems to do a gret job cleaning, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality cordless stick vacuum!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,1,30-Jul-21,Dwayne06,Horrible for pet hair!,"I was torn between this and the dyson...I should have gone with the dyson.  The design for picking up pet hair is horrible!  It gets clogged every two minutes because of the cleaning lever.  Unfortunately, because of the price of this useless vacuum.... I’m stuck with it!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,18-Jul-21,ShelbyBill,Easy to use.," I examined several brands of stick vacuums and chose the LG model A927KVMS for it's ease to use & performance specifications. It has turned out to be an excellent choice. Size, weight and battery run time were the top 3 decision makers!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,4,16-Jul-21,Stacethegreat,Love it!, I'm happy with this purchase. I have carpet and it picks up dirt/ dust that my previous vacuum didn't.  I love the kompressor feature and all the additional attachments.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,8-Jul-21,ernestelg,Very convenient, Have had this great vacuum for a month now and the  convenience of it has made vacuuming much less of a chore. No more dealing with a cord and having to plug in at different outlets in my house. Maintenance is easy and simple. I can do my whole house and still have 2/3 of battery life. Was concerned at first because of how small it is that it would have issues with the pet hair but so far it has been a champ. We owned the upright kompressor and it was the best vacuum we ever owned and as of now this might surpass it.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,21-May-21,Gforce1004,Such a good vacuum!, I definitely recommend this vacuum. It’s lightweight and the cleaning is easy. I was able to remove the tank and battery pack instantly.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,7-May-21,ShawnC,What a Game Changer," I bought this vacuum because I have a dog now and she sheds like crazy. I can vacuum my entire house on one battery. (1200 sg ft).  I use the Normal mode on the bare floors and my area rugs and it works great and doesn't attach itself or try to ""eat"" to my rugs. LOVE that! I use Power mode for my large room sized rugs and no need for turbo, so far. I was afraid I would need to empty the dust bin a few times while vacuuming, due to its size, but with the Kompressor lever feature, I did not!!! The accessories are really nice, as well. The flexible hose extension and flexible crevice tool are amazing and make cleaning hard to get to spaces a breeze! The weight really isn't that bad. It's easy to remove and put back in the charging stand. It maneuvers really well and feels good in your hand. Great design. What else can I say...I love this vacuum!!!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,30-Apr-21,Irishannie,Best Vacuum EVER!!!!!!!," This vacuum is amazing, easy to put together. Picks up so much dust and dirt. I love that there is no cord and it can go anywhere."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,25-Apr-21,Judy7,Easy to handle," I am no longer strong enough to handle the hose on my whole house vacuum, so I searched for a light weight stick vacuum, & after much research I chose the LG.  Despite weak hands & poor balance, I can easily do quick cleanups & stay on top of the daily crumbs & dust on my carpets.  I also love that there is an on off switch, it is always charged & has a backup battery."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,4,15-Mar-21,Ragsgolf,No more lugging a heavy hose and canister," I bought this stick vacuum because I was afraid that I might trip and fall dragging a hose and canister vacuum around.  I had tried an upright but felt it didn't really clean deeply enough.  And either of those options seemed hard on my back.  Solution--a battery operated stick vacuum. After a good deal of research I chose the LG.  It is so much easier to use.  No cords.  It's lightweight.  It has terrific suction.  It is easy to empty and filters the dust. My only complaint is that there is no brush only attachment.  Unfortunately, when I replaced the majority of the carpet in my house with Coretec Luxury Vinyl planks, I discovered that a rotating brush was inadvisable to use on the LVP.  Otherwise I would rate the LG CordZero ThinQ stick vacuum a 5 star."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,4-Mar-21,Jennifer1979,I Love it, I love it soooo much.. so easy to carry and convenient
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,4,3-Mar-21,suomi,Works as promised," We have cats and mostly hardwood. This vacuum does well handling both. It's pretty good on rugs as well, though it needs to be on the highest setting to work best on rugs. Emptying is easy and efficient. It's very early in the ownership period, but so far the battery life is excellent and more than enough to handle our entire house. I certainly don't miss a traditional corded vacuum and this is superior to the Dysons I've tried."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,4,3-Mar-21,yuyuyu08,Happy with this overall," I have been using this for a month now. I am happy with this vacuum overall. I have dysons(canister) also and am using both of them. I feel like LG one does better job. I am pretty small and if I use my one hand for this vacuum, my arm gets tired but I also injured my elbow and recovering. It is handy, have long batter life, and emptying the bin is not that bad. Some reviews say emptying bin is not easy but it is fine for me. One thing I wish about this one is that I would like to take the head part out and wash it with water. But there is a motor that I cannot run the head with water. Other than that I am very happy with this one. I would recommend it!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,27-Feb-21,Tennessee37932,Wish we had upgraded sooner," Great vacuum! After one month of use this stick vacuum has completely replaced both our old upright and old handheld units.  About two thirds of a battery is easily enough to do the whole house (2500 sq ft), so running out of battery is not a worry. The standard head is very maneuverable and works well on our carpet, tile and hardwood. The completely cordless vacuum is light enough that vacuuming is much less a chore. The stand with tools and extra battery is very convenient.  I was impressed by the packaging - the box is surprisingly small, with an excellent layout of the components and very easy to follow instructions. So much easier than our last vacuums. Happy to have purchased this version and upgraded from our older units.

Tip: the kompressor lever is also useful for emptying the vacuum."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,21-Feb-21,Tahoe Life,Great power," Use at my skin studio, works great to remove debris from clients walking in from parking lot. Love the size and 2 batteries."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,20-Feb-21,Jagxk8,Ease of use, It’s been a very pleasant surprise of how much we’ve enjoyed this product
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,3,17-Feb-21,Justdes220,I love the vacuum but my charging station, I love the Kompressor part and the suction is so much better than the dyson I have. I love how you don’t have to hold down a trigger and the batteries last a long time but this is now the 2nd day of owning this vacuum and now the charging stand will not charge. It will light up as I push the cord into the port but then it stops and doesn’t work. I don’t know if it is the port or the charger but I am frustrated with the fact of having to go back to the store to hopefully exchange it or get a different model vacuum altogether.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,1,14-Feb-21,The Ann D,No suction," Doesn’t even work that well on bare floors, worse on fabrics.  What a joke for how much it costs!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,8-Feb-21,JewelryGirl,Easy to Use!, This is the best all around vacuum I have ever purchased.  I can clean my entire house better than I could before in half the time.  Lightweight and easy to use; it has made me want to clean my house!  Highly recommend this product from LG.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,3-Feb-21,TL21,Great upgrade with Kompressor," One of the great features of this product is Kompressor. I did a lot of research on LG and other vacuum cleaners, and I believe this product can be the best cleaner in the market. Kompressor is a great feature and help me easily empty. It is very smooth when cleaning hardwood and carpet and also quiet compared to my previous cleaner. One drawback would be that I feel a little heavy when using 2-1 combination tool and crevice tool because I need to hold this vacuum with one hand, but this is still a great vacuum. I also like its batter lif, Power Punch Nozzle, and WiFi technology."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,1,1-Feb-21,not to smart,when it's works it's work good, the unit works well when it's works my did not last 2 months before it broke
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,2,28-Jan-21,PhillyJoe,Less than stellar perfomance, Overpriced for the performance. Very disappointed with purchase. Without turbo mode this wireless vacuum would be useless.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,4,25-Jan-21,Philpops,Great Mchine, I love this vac! Very convenient sense its cordless and has 2 batteries. The only drar back is that sometimes thick rugs are a little difficult. You have to lift up the machine so that only the wheels (which are only in the front) are touching the carpet. Someone please contact me if this is not the case!! Otherwise it's works out great for me!
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,4,13-Jan-21,BlumenKenner,Great for quick run thru the house but use Turbo, Great for quick jobs. Must use Turbo or Turbo+ mode. Very quiet. Soooo Easy!!
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,12-Jan-21,Moe0807,Love it!," Bought this last month and love it! All my appliances are LG, I think their the best!"

homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,4-Jan-21,Penny34,Great features and battery life!!," I bought this vacuum about a month ago and I’m in love! The turbo suction is amazing and just the battery life alone for be is a huge plus. I had a Dyson before and it was great but the battery would die way too fast and I didn’t have enough time to finish but with my LG, I have more than enough time on one battery and I have a second battery for just incase. That’s awesome!!!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,3-Jan-21,BWMike,Great features, Never thought we would enjoy a cordless vac as much as this one
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,4,2-Jan-21,Pfitzz77,Easy whole floor cleaning," My LG stick vacuum has made it so much easier to clean the whole floor, I am now vacuuming every other day because it goes so quickly. I have three cats and two dogs and the pet hair buildup can be intense, but having this vacuum has cut way down on the dust in the house."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,2-Jan-21,Kathyftw52,Easy to use, This vacuum is so easy to use and maneuver. So much more than other products I have used. And the batteries last forever.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,30-Dec-20,Cory 3,Light, So happy with this.  It is so light and easy to use.  Easy to clean.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,29-Dec-20,StephieDiB,I felt like I finally had real vacuum!, The first time I used my LG portable vacuum I realized how ineffective the corded electric vacuum I had been using was.  I live on the beach and sand always manages to make its way in.  I gave my oriental rug a good going over with the my LG and could not believe how much sand and dirt the vacuum extracted.  The color of the carpet actually brightened.  And it is so much easier to do the steps!  I am sold!
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,29-Dec-20,T H 2,Mighty & Light," We purchased this cordless stick vac because it has a hepa filter system intending to use it for light duty maintenance as an alternative to our obstreperous Miele canister.  Surprise!! Although it is nimble & light, it does a mighty job and is now my go to vac - effective on floors, carpet and area rugs alike. A nifty well designed attachment makes upholstery vacuuming a cinch - & we have a persian kitty!  
My only caution is that it does take a little effort to clean the filter system since it is bagless, but it is mostly washable - even the hepa - and well designed.
One more plus - it is incredibly quiet and can barely be heard across the house when running. The 2 batteries on our model that may be simultaneously charged make this cordless a winner for me."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,29-Dec-20,Camper50,This vacuum has made my life so much easier!," As a retired senior citizen, I am always looking for ways to simplify my life. This vacuum is so easy to use. With the wide variety of accessories, it makes cleaning easy and quick. It is always ready. My only regret was not buying it sooner!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,26-Dec-20,JL48,Very handy," This cordless vacuum is great and very handy, just grab and go without the hassle of getting out the large corded vacuum. Much easier cleaning the stairs with the cordless, and for cleaning up other areas, I've never had to exchange batteries while in use, one battery has gotten it done. Great product and the dust cup holds much more than I thought it would"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,26-Dec-20,Skip68,Great vacuum, This vacuum is easy to use and has great battery life.  It has good vacuum and the emptying of the waste bin is a breeze.  It is the best stick vacuum we have ever used.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,26-Dec-20,Nance1,Fast and Furious!, Very agile with great suction.  Maneuvers anywhere and holds a charge throughout the entire house.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,15-Dec-20,Jrandy,Excellant product, Very happy with this vacuum. Does a great job and is easy to use and put away. A little more expensive than some others but well worth it to me.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,12-Dec-20,fatootst,very happy with it, lightweight and easy to use. like longer use battery
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,4,11-Dec-20,Paciferous,Best investment," We have been using this for 4 months now and absolutely satisfied with the performance of the machine. We have two pets and lots of fur to clean up. This does an excellent job of removing all
the fur in the deep clean mode from both carpet and hardwood floor. Excellent battery life with two both batteries combine and can easily get through the house in one charge. Some of the improvements can be around the Power Nozzle to perform better on hardwood floor. It’s not the best tool for picking up larger debris. Filters need regular cleaning to maintain optimum performance."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,9-Dec-20,Pegarr,Exceeded expectations!,"I received this as an early Christmas gift.  I’ve never owned a stick vacuum before and was hoping I wouldn’t be disappointed.  This vacuum has great suction, is easy to maneuver and I love not having to deal with a cord and plug.  I highly recommend this vacuum!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,7-Dec-20,Lanity1018,Better than Dyson," My girlfriend and I got this in October before we moved into our new apartment and my goodness. The fact that my hand doesnt cramp from holding a trigger to keep it going is one of the main reasons its better. A reusable filter is great for saving money, the aesthetic is clean. Charging base with extra battery is nice. Long battery life for a whole apartment cleaning on turbo is amazing. Just the ease of use and the simplicity of it makes it that much better. If you are debating between the two of dyson and this one. Go with the LG."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,1,22-Oct-20,frosty0601,Extremely Disappointed,"I have been been a huge fan of LG, however, for the price of the product I feel LG has cheated me. To begin with for the price this product does not come with a soft roll brush. In addition it does a horrible job on cleaning carpets. It also has a tough time picking up small cheerios."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,20-Oct-20,fshrman,Great Features," We purchased this LG Cord Zero Ultimate Kompressor Stick Vacuum and absolutely Love it.  We have a central vac but tripping on the hose and changing locations where we have to install the hose is a real pain.  This LG Cordless is the answer to our problem.
We have this Vintage Wine version with the Kompressor in our office and it looks very nice.  The Quality is very good and easy to put together."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,29-Jul-20,Anonymous,Lightweight," I recently got this vacuum and I really like it! Its lightweight and has good suction, it works well on my tiled floor and carpet. I also like the kompressor, it makes it easier for me to empty the can into the trash"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,26-Jul-20,Rich3807,"As with most of LG's products, I am impressed!"," The CordZero A9 vacuum came in a well laid out box, with thorough, easy to understand instructions. All the components are individually secure, easy to unpack, and the packaging is entirely recyclable. Like all LG products, the vacuum's overall design and appearance is very nice and stylish.

This vacuum has noticeably more suction power than my ""leading brand"" stick vacuum while somehow also being much quieter. Upon initial use, I noticed the A9 picked up so much more dirt to a floor that was just cleaned with my previous stick vacuum.

The telescoping wand is a nice feature to be able to adjust to different heights. This makes it more comfortable for me to vacuum stairs where I need a shorter wand as well as varying heights when I may need more reach to vacuum overhead (curtains, blinds, etc).

The LG A9 is only a couple ounces heavier than my previous stick vacuum but it feels so much better in my hand. Overall the vacuum feels more balanced because of the well distributed weight. I find the grip more comfortable as it's molded for a better relaxed grip and has rubber back to rest against my palm. I especially like that I don't have to hold a trigger button down to run the vacuum like my previous stick vacuum. This allows you to relax your grip rather than having to use a tighter grip while holding the power button down. 

I love that this comes with two batteries for continuous cleaning. One battery lasts a long time already (nearly 40 min each) but it's reassuring knowing I'm not restricted and can keep cleaning. It's thoughtful that the base can charge the spare battery in a separate compartment while also charging the battery that's in the vacuum.

While the dirt bin isn't as big as some competitors, the Kompressor feature comes in handy to maximizing the capacity while keeping the vacuum lite weight and size relatively compact. The Kompressor feature allows you to extend the time between emptying the bin by compacting the dirt down.

Overall I would strongly recommend this vacuum. It's well designed and very comfortable to use. The vacuum has several replaceable parts if needed and has a very long warranty on the motor."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,22-Jul-20,jstu140,"Lightweight, easy to use and durable"," I wanted a vacuum that was lightweight, but most importantly, something that would clean areas thoroughly. I was pleasantly surprised how well the suction was and how much dust/dirt it picked up from my area rugs. 

The product was super easy to assemble and the extra accessories were a great addition to clean small areas like my car and in between the sofa. The battery is amazing and has lasted a while. I haven't had to re-charge it for some time, however I only have 3-4 area rugs that I've cleaned within the last few weeks. I also like how the vac isn't obnoxiously loud when used in the normal setting compared to other traditional vacuums. 

The kompressor is a nice touch considering that the bin is small. I truly does the job in compressing all the dirt and debris the vacuum captures making it relatively easy to empty. 

Overall, I'm really happy with the product and the features it has to offer."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,20-Jul-20,eitak,Lightweight and easy to use, This vacuum is extremely easy to use and is very light weight. You’re able to bring it up and downstairs without a problem and get under furniture with ease.  I highly recommend it
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,19-Jul-20,LGKompressorReviewer,"powerful, yet quiet portable vacuum"," The LG A927KGMS ""Kompressor"" stick vacuum is part of the A9 series.  It features four attachments: 1) a short crevice wand, 2) a short brush wand, 3) an upholstery tool and 4) a dual hard and soft-surface (i.e. rugs and carpet) tool.  The unit comes with two LiOn batteries both of which can charge simultaneously in the dock (which can be wall mounted with included drywall accessories).  The only major drawback to this unit is that the dock has room for just two accessories with a third mounted to the suction motor unit while the fourth really has nowhere to go.

You'll notice a major difference between this vacuum and a powerful floor model immediately because the LG Kompressor A9 is very quiet, compact and lightweight (~6lbs).  Holstering the unit back into the dock is easy, as it removing it for a quick clean wherever you need it.  The attachments each have a push button slider that allows them to connect and disconnect with ease.  You can also adjust the length of the floor attachment.

Although the debris collector is not very large, emptying it into a rubbish bin is a snap.  LG even includes a ""shower cap"" so that you can bathe the filter elements of this vacuum without getting some the delicate electronic parts wet.  Quite clever!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,19-Jul-20,Bemem,No more dog hair!," I am obsessed with vacuuming, especially because I have a very large dog that sheds 24/7, but I haven’t found a vacuum that doesn’t the trick the make my house feel completely dog hair free. However, this vacuum did the trick! It sucks up dog hair fast and easy and left my house spotless. Love how lightweight it was so I could easily do my entire house. Highly recommend for anyone who has a dog or any animal that sheds - this is the vacuum you need!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,3,7-Jul-20,HB63,A little Disappointed," I was very excited to try a cordless vacuum cleaner, being cordless I knew cleanup would be much easier for me and quicker.  The lg cord zero is a very lightweight vacuum and it moves around the floors very easily.  The vacuum is excellent for uncarpeted floors and even worked well on the outdoor carpet.  Having two batteries was a plus for the vacuum especially when you have a lot of area to cover while cleaning.  I really liked the freestanding stand and all the accessories.  The only problem I had with the vacuum is that it didn’t vacuum my thicker carpet well.  The suction was not strong enough for the thicker carpet in the turbo or regular mode."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,4-Jul-20,AgentMully,Really sucks!!, This little vacuum is amazing! I was not expecting there to be real sucking power out of a cordless vacuum but I took it to my dog room and my floor is SPOTLESS! It was covered in hair (I have five dogs) and some dirt from their paws and this little thing got them all! The only thing I would change is to make the bin bigger... I had to change it three times in a 10x10 room... but otherwise it’s the best vac I’ve ever had!!!
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,3-Jul-20,Abracadebra,Awesome Machine!," My first impression was the way this vacuum was beautifully boxed up so I anticipated something wonderful was in store. It was easy to assemble and it cleans better than the other very reputable brands. I was surprised at the amount of dog hair that was extracted from practically new carpet. And even though there's not a so-called hard floor attachment, the power carpet nozzle handled all our tile and wood flooring (without being noisy like the manual stated). I was pleased the carpet nozzle head glides under kitchen cabinet toe kicks and furniture as well as pivots around corners and tight spaces. It operates so quietly, I could still hear the TV and the exhaust air didn't blow me away. Another benefit is the power button doesn't have to be compressed the entire time of vacuuming. With so many attachments, this lightweight vacuum will tackle all my floors, upholstery, bedding, vehicles and so much more. This vacuum is just as awesome as our other trusted LG products and the LG CordZero is highly recommended."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,3-Jul-20,Mary1861,Wow!!," This is a very powerful vacuum that runs on rechargeable batteries. Included is a charging station and extra battery. Goes from carpet to hardwood floors with having to switch anything over. Very lightweight, not bulky. Quieter than I expected it would be.  Dirt bin is easy to empty. I do like that I can detach the top and put different attachments on and clean my couches and hubby cleaned the car. Only if it mopped too lol. Great quality."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,3-Jul-20,luciekitty04,Very powerful!," I have experience with the Dyson cordless stick vacuum, but this one is so much more powerful! It is a little heavier, but for good reason. One thing I love about this cordless vacuum is the option of using the stand to charge it. The Dyson charging station has to be hung on the wall, and this one can as well, but it also comes with a very sturdy stand to charge it. Another feature I love that beats the Dyson is the push lever it has to ""squeegee""  the dirt down and into the trash. You still have to press the release lever to open the canister, but then you have the push lever to get everything out!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,2-Jul-20,SherriM13,Works amazingly, Using the A927KGMS vacuum has been so great. I love that it comes with an extra battery and attachments. Having three boys there's always something on the floor and this vacuum has picked up cheeze its crumbs and goldfish crackers. I haven't found any problems with it. It is super easy to put together and use with a push of a button.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,2-Jul-20,russell34,glorious device," I bought this to make my daily vacuuming easier and it succeeded.  this vacuum is not only very light weight and easy to maneuver,  but it also comes with a charging  stand two batteries and best part is no long cord . I now can clean without my kids or pets tripping the cord and unplugging it . I was so shocked and happy with now easy it picks up the dirt."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,30-Jun-20,Stevelis,WONDERFUL," We have been using this vacuum multiple times a day since we received it because we are remodeling. This is not a single con to this vacuum. It comes with so many attachments, the suction is AMAZING. We have used it on our rugs, hardwood, stairs, vehicles and in tight spaces, it’s so lightweight and with arthritis that’s a huge plus. The battery life is amazing and it comes with TWO batteries that both charge on the dock at the same time. I love that the filters are washable and reusable. It’s very quiet which is great with a newborn. It also extends for taller people.  As a home with seven kids, a cat and three dogs this vacuum does not disappoint!!!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,30-Jun-20,busyguy7447,Fantastic in looks and operation!," I have a Dyson stick vacuum that is getting elderly so this unit has a high bar to meet. I am happy to say that it has exceeded that bar!  The unit is sleek and light. It took more time to unwrap all the protective covering than it did to put the unit together. The unit can be wall mounted for ease of access (which I did); the battery holds the charge plenty long enough for me to complete one floor. The suction works great and my mounds of dog hair stand no chance agains this unit. The unit is flexible and easy to steer. Easy to empty as well.  This is a versatile and really, really nice unit."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,29-Jun-20,star302002,Great Product," LG CordZeroThinQ Kompressor Cordless Stick Vacuum
I got from TryIt. 
This vacuum is amazing I'm extremely satisfied.. It’s cordless,having no cord is 
life changing! it’s lightweight. 
It goes easily under your couch & beds without having to move your furniture.
It comes with a backup battery and tons of attachments, and it’s able to be 
maneuvered between tight spaces. The battery life is great and it does a 
phenomenal job picking up cat hairs that seem to get absolutely 
everywhere. It is surprisingly quiet and the suctioning power is great. 
Also this vacuum goes right from carpet to hard surfaces without having 
to change the function. I highly recommend."
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,29-Jun-20,O SKI BOB 2,Definitely worth the cost, I have been using this for a few weeks and have been extremely satisfied. The battery life is great and it does a phenomenal job picking up my dogs short hair that seems to get absolutely everywhere. It is surprisingly quiet and the suctioning power is great. Very glad I made the switch.
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,29-Jun-20,K3V1N G,Amazing vacuum," This vacuum is amazing. It’s cordless, it’s lightweight, it makes minimal sound, It comes with a backup battery and tons of attachments, and it’s able to be maneuvered between tight spaces. I originally thought this would be a secondary vacuum for me, but after using it the first time, I quickly realized this may take over as my primary vacuum. My only complain (and this is a personal thing) was that after using it for a while, my hand started hurting. It would be nice if there was some type of rubber/comfort grip for when you’re using it for extended periods of time. Regardless, I would still purchase this 10 outta 10 times!"
homedepot,LG A927KVMS,5,29-May-20,soccermom68,Small but Mighty," This is the best cordless vacuum out there!! I purchased this in November 2019, it was the best decision ever. 1st having no cord is life changing! 2nd its light weight so carrying it around from floor to floors is easy. 3rd it goes flat so you can vacuum easily under your couch/beds without moving your furniture. 4th I am able to vacuum both floors of our house 2300sf without the battery dying. 5th the dirt tank is small but it compacts so well i can vacuum multiple times without having to empty. 6th the power booster is great when i have to pick up the dog hair that sticks to our carpet on the steps 7th being able to break it down and use the handheld on the steps is so much nicer than using our old one that had a cord on it. 8th Love the out of the way charging/mounting station (which by the way charges super fast if you end up needing yours charged) This little guy is small/light weight but is just as powerful as a fullsize plug in vacuum - the suction is actually better than any of our old vacuums we ever had. Also this vacuum goes right from carpet to hard surfaces without having to change the fuction. I actually enjoy vacuuming now!!!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,4,1-Nov-22,Mactastic,AUTOMATIC EMPTYING INTO A BAG!,"I received this vacuum about a week ago, and I’ve been using it for every day cleaning of my entire house. It has powerful suction, and it’s much quieter than cordless vacuums I’ve purchased previously. My favorite feature is the self-empty base, which automatically empties the contents of the dust bin into a sealed bag. No longer do I have to touch the contents of the dust bin, which will always be a plus. I simply remove, and throw away the bag, then insert a new bag into the self-empty base. Let’s not forget that the vacuum comes with not one, but two batteries that I can swap when one runs out of juice. The self-empty base will charge the additional battery while I’m vacuuming. With this vacuum I can track my cleaning history over Wi-Fi with the LG ThinQ app. Unfortunately, it isn’t without flaws, and requires improvement. Prepare to cut and/or remove long hair from the brushroll. It’s best to have a nozzle that prevents long hair from wrapping around the brushroll. Also there’s no illumination on the nozzle so I can’t see what I’m vacuuming."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,31-Oct-22,Kymbro,Love the ease of vacuuming now!,"I've had this just over a week and absolutely love it! Is it the strongest, most powerful vacuum that'll efficiently do shag carpets? No. But it's great for picking up cat litter off the vinyl floor and I've been more apt to do that with this cordless beauty. I threw away my little broom I used to use. I'm not sure what I like best the cordless feature or the self-cleaning feature. 
Also I like the mop! Is it the best? Again, no. But it's sufficient for small areas at a time. It's a bit slow but on my vinyl flooring it works fairly well. 
I was nervous to spend the amount I spent on this but I'm glad I did thus far!!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,29-Oct-22,Cinci NY,Worth the price,Love this machine.  Best cordless…powerful but not too loud.  Love the auto depending into a bag so the canister stays looking clean. I was pleasantly surprised that it comes with a floor mop!
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,7-Oct-22,JHule7,Second to none.,"Absolutely fantastic. This vacuum does everything you need and more. I love how it automatically cleans itself when you plug it back into the port. Yes it may be more than other competitors, but it is in a league in its own and is an investment!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,6-Oct-22,Vyatk,The best!,"The best cordless vacuum I’ve ever had. Not only that it works on different surfaces, I also love the mop feature. It’s literally a multi-tools combined."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,3-Oct-22,BennyJR,Great vacuum great accessories and power," I have used this brand new vacuum for quite some weeks already.
It has great suction power and the accessories are a 5 star along with the battery life and the extra one that comes included with it so you won’t stop once you started working with it.
With the different attachments or tools makes this vacuum a versatile and very light weight vacuum that our money can buy now a days..
Now the self emptying feature it makes me love it even more …
Love it.. definitely would recommend it to family and friends"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,25-Sep-22,Anonymous,Great features.  Cabinet organizes all accessories,Bought one and loved it so much bought another one!!  Love the mopping feature and extra battery but mostly love how it empties after each use!
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,17-Sep-22,AceofSpades1996,10/10 Would Recommend!," I have owned this vacuum for about 6 months now, and I am impressed with the suction it provides and the battery life. The difference attachments make this vacuum one of the most versatile, if not THE most versatile (and lightweight!) vacuums money can buy currently! The LG mobile app this device pairs with could use some refining. The self emptying feature is me and my 2 year old sons favorite feature by far. The only thing I wish was different about this product is that it came with more dust bins for the self emptying feature within the housing for the vacuum. Overall I am happy with this purchase! Thanks LG!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,4,7-Sep-22,hjh2c,Love this LG CordZero Vaccuum!," I have recently gotten the LG Electronics CordZero Vaccuum and love so many things about this handy device! The vacuum came with so many assorted attachments including one for pet hair and a mopping attachment. It also came with an extra battery which I love!  The run time on one battery is a little over an hour if I keep it in auto mode and don't switch to Turbo. I love having that extra battery on hand and charged up the Tower when I need it. One unique feature about the CordZero is that it's handy base recharges it, stores the extra parts, battery and attachments as well as has an Auto Empty feature for cleaning out the debris from the vacuum dust bin! I love that is takes one more clean up step out of my normal routine! The tower is makes keeping all of the extra things that can be used with the vacuum so nice and tidy and in one spot for easy access. The vacuum is lightweight and the main attachment is easy to get around and under furniture. I like that the main attachment head is a bit smaller than some of the others I've seen as it can really get into tight spaces and under chairs. I love that when I turn it on, I don't have to keep holding down on a button to keep the suction going as I've had to do on vacuums I've had in the past. It does seamlessly from my hardwood to my tile to my carpet rugs and has a great Turbo mode that can be turned on for those places I worry have extra hard to reach dirt. The CordZero even has ap app that you can connect to that will show you run times. extra info on the troubleshooting and battery life. I think one of the super exciting things about the CordZero is that it has a mop attachment. Although this feature didn't live up to my expectations, I'll thrilled of the idea of a vacuum/mop combo!  The mop attachment has a place to put in water and it has little round pads that velcro on to the vacuum and spin around once you start it up. You can control the amount of water that comes out (it has a low to high setting) but the problem  I had was that I didn't think it really ""mopped"" my floor. There was moisture but it can't be used with soap or cleaner of any kind and I just don't feel like my floor are properly ""mopped "" with just a slight layer of water. I used the microfiber mop heads for about 15 minutes on my tile while I was trying out the mopping feature and once done, the mop heads were already frazzled and looked to be coming undone. I love the IDEA of the mop combo, but in my ideal world, it would have been able to be used with a cleaner to really get it good and clean and I would have more function in the amount of water that comes out ( I couldn't tell much difference in the low or high adjustments on the mop attachment). Also, the suction is turned off when you use the mop attachment and I would love to see a function added to be able to use the mop with water and cleaner and then have it sucked back up or go back over the water with a drying function. Again, I love the idea, but feel like the mop attachment could have some improvement to make it a 5 star product. I do like that the mop attachment has a little blue light that shines to help show you where the water is on the floor. Overall, I am thrilled with the uniqueness and creativity that this LG CordZero Vacuum brings to my home. The tower with it's multitude of functions is a real game changer in my book!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,7-Sep-22,Anonymous,All the bells and whistles!," This vacuum has all the bells and whistles!  The wi-fi I'm not quite sure of yet, but it has every head you will need to clean your home, it even has a mop head!!  This vacuum is super light weight, but still manages to get all the dirt up.  I am completely taken with this product and will recommend it to everyone."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,7-Sep-22,Gjohnson12,Great vacuum, This LG Zero Cord Vacuum is amazing! It is a cordless vacuum which makes it very easy to clean because u can pick it up and go anywhere with it. There are two batteries that come with it so you can change it out when one is done for uninterrupted cleaning. There is all in one tower. The tower serves as a battery charging station that charges two batteries. You can clean and charge them at the same time with 120 minutes.it also  conveniently and discretely stores tools and accessories. Inside the tower there is also an auto empty that empties the dirt cup when the vacuum is docked.there are three vacuum bags that come with it for emptying debris. it has Kompressor technology that compacts the dirt inside the dust bin. It has one touch press button that turns it on/off or you can select turbo power mode. The vacuum has a telescopic wand so you can adjust it to reach those high places. This vacuum is also a mop! It comes with mop heads and a power mop nozzle . You can mop hardwood floor with this and you can easily vacuum them too. It cleans carpets with ease and picks up pet hair very well too with the pet nozzle. It has Wi-Fi ThinQ which helps so you can run your vacuum for maintenance and diagnostics for upkeep ! Overall this vacuum is fantastic to have!!
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,6-Sep-22,Jay323,Fantastic features," This vacuum is by far better than fantastic. The feature that this has are amazing. Let me start with the sucking power of this vacuum. When this is on normal it is strong and great for loose crumbs, pet hair , dirt, etc. click it up to turbo and it get down deep in the carpet for dirt a normal vacuum can’t get. Next let’s go to the battery life. 2 batteries are more than enough to clean an entire house (my house is 2800sq/ft) and I have battery to spare. Let’s move on to the accessories you get all the tools you need to clean furniture under heat registers to tight spaces behind fridges and under tables. The wet mop head is efficient in cleaning your hard floors to a great shine and clean the mop head is very easy. Now let’s go to the base, it hides all the tools neatly and it looks modern and no one would know what is in there. The base also sucks out the dirt from the unit into a bag in the base for a hands free cleaning of the dirt out of the unit. Finally the wi fi option is great. Get the app and it tell you how much the vacuum is used, when the batteries are fully charged, the last day you vacuumed, how long you vacuumed, etc. This is a very durable product and is well worth the purchase. I don’t know how I made it with out one of these. NO POWER CORDS is great as well. All wireless."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,4,5-Sep-22,Lawrence McClurkin,Big investment but great if you can afford it.,Comparable to the high end dyson but the self cleaning feature is actually pretty clutch.
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,4-Sep-22,Annabelle S,Quiet and effective," I’m really happy with this vacuum. It took me probably only half and hour to set it up with the stand by myself. Cleaning-wise, it works very effectively in one pass and runs way quieter than any of my previous vacuums. Love that it charges and empties itself!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,4-Sep-22,JuneDee,The greatest QUIETEST vacuum ever!," To begin I must say the set up instructions were superb. The set up instructions are so easy that from opening the box to starting the device should take 30 minutes or less.this vacuum has an amazing suction level. It is so quiet it is amazingly hard to believe how powerful the suction is. I must say if your still at this point having second thoughts , please don’t hesitate to purchase the biggest bonus is NO CORD. There is so many great features with this vacuum it’s hard to name them all . Including self cleaning vacuum multiple cleaning tools. This is a must purchase !!!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,3-Sep-22,littlerabbit,The perfect vacuum!," I've been very impressed with this vacuum so far. Took a bit to set it all up but once you're done you have an all-in-one tower/charge station that contains everything you need. All the attachments are stored inside the tower - no clutter at all! The actual vacuum is sleek and lightweight, and the lack of a cord offers so much freedom. It transitions easily between carpet and hardwood floors, and suction is strong even without going into the highest setting. It comes with an extra battery that sits in the tower until you need it, but I haven't had to use it yet! The main perk of this vacuum is the auto-emptying feature; once you've finished vacuuming you just place it back into the charge station and it'll empty itself into a bag installed inside. You can set this to automatic or manual with just a press of a button (and if you're wondering if you can still manually empty it, you can!) There's also an app you can use, and while it's not required to use the vacuum it's very useful to have as it greatly helps with maintenance. I'd recommend it even if you're not a big fan of constant apps like I am. Overall I'd say it's exceeded my expectations. It's plenty strong and the convenience of going cordless is just too good. You'll definitely love cleaning with this vacuum!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,2-Sep-22,Ash80,LG CordZero ThinQ Vaccum," LG Cordzero cordless stick vacuum is made for cleaning your home with smart features. It's packed with accessories and features like the Kompressor system that compacts the dirt,dust and debris during cleaning.Auto Empty feature is phenomenal, simply place your vacuum into the storage/Charging base and press start/stop button and the LG Cord zero will empty itself into a dust bag,
 .I love the ThinQ app that works with the Vaccum and sends you notifications when to clean filters,battery indicators also if there's clogs,lodged debris in system.The LG Cord zero  has a mop as well that is amazing,just use plain water, with Velcro  washable mop pads,The cleaning nozzles are great ,a pet hair nozzle,angle nozzle for corners,mattress nozzle,LG has made an amazing ,innovative smart way to clean your home with smart technology at its finest, a must have for every home and the best clean is the LG CordZero thinQ."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,1-Sep-22,Olivia Moon,Extraordinary vacuum!," The LG CordZero has immediately become my favorite vacuum! Set up was so simple for the tower, the vacuum itself, and the Wi-Fi/ThiQ app. First thing I did was get the batteries charging. Being able to charge the extra battery to have ready at all times is convenience at its finest! Next up was putting all the accessories in their place inside the tower. How wonderful to have a place for everything, right where you need it. I enjoy vacuuming so much more when it’s cordless. Cleaning can be a pain, having to drag a cord behind you, needing to switch plugs when you move onto a farther room! I am ecstatic to be cord free! I am able to go directly from the hardwood floors, to the tiled floors, and right to the carpet with ease. There’s no change in suction, no switch needing to be switched. It’s completely effortless. The battery life is superb. Two-story home, multiple bathrooms and bedrooms, a loft, kitchen, dining room, office, and a laundry room… all vacuumed with battery still remaining, 1/3rd to be exact. Let me tell you, you never knew you needed your vacuum to empty itself until you have this LG CordZero Vacuum!! I never would have thought that would be my favorite feature. It’s incredible! The pictures I have attached are from the first use, after vacuuming with my current vacuum the day before! This not only shows that the suction power of the Smart Inverter Motor can get what your current vacuum is leaving behind, but also how well the auto empty feature works! Just when you think this vacuum can’t get any better…  Power Mop attachment! Amazing! This one vacuum has been able to replace three cleaning tools (stick vacuum, dust buster, and mop) for me and I am so thankful!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,1-Sep-22,Chris863,One word! AMAZING!, I have to tell you that have never been so excited to use this LG CordZero vacuum! It is so quiet and powerful! Has several attachments for cleaning hard to reach places and has floor mopping attachment unlike anything I’ve ever used! So light and easy to use. I love how the stand holds everything neatly and charges the unit when placed in the cradle. The spare charger is great if you need to change out the battery in a hurry. The most exciting thing happens when you are done! This this cleans itself automatically! Thus LG vacuum is amazing and I definitely recommend it! Thanks LG for being so innovative! I’m impressed
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,1-Sep-22,Ann59,Makes cleaning enjoyable," I was so excited to get the LG Cordzero with ThinQ.  With it being cordless,  I can vacuum my whole house without searching for nearby outlets and having to plug and replace my vacuum. It has two batteries to ensure that I can finish the job.  The charging tower serves as the charging base as well as storing all the extra attachments. You can quickly switch the attachments. It has a crevasse tool to reach between couch cushions, a dusting brush, a pet tool to easily pick up pet hair from my furniture, there's even a mop attachment to do hard surfaces.  The ThinQ app will help with maintenance of the vacuum. It has a gratis that will automatically empty the debris that you've vacuumed after each time you use the vacuum. With the kompressor, you can compact debris you've picked up giving additional space to finish vacuuming.  The wand is adjustable in length. There are three modes of vacuum power."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,1-Sep-22,Steph887766,Awesome vac with all of the bells and whistles!," Is there anything this vacuum can’t do?! It’s awesome! It is high quality and well made. The construction of this compares to other stick vacs is top notch. The tube is metal where most others are plastic. The mop function is amazing and quick when there is a spill, and I love all of the stick vac accessories that come with it. The auto empty function saves us a ton of dust in the house now that we don’t need to empty our vacuum manually! I love it, and I don’t know how I lived without it before!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,1-Sep-22,Goldfish12,Amazing, I am very impressed by this vacuum. It has amazing suction and the noise level is very low. There are so many attachments which I love. It's very sleek and slender so it easily fits into any space. My only complaint are the doors. There is not latch so they can easily swivel open.
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,4,1-Sep-22,CJM2,Great When it Works," So many appliances now are highly advanced and innovative. They come with mobile apps and lengthy instructions. This vacuum is something new for sure. I am usually not a huge fan of mobile apps for everything but knowing when the vacuum is fully charged or has an issue by checking my phone can be handy sometimes.

 As for the vacuum itself; it works well. I, personally, had no issues with suction. Honestly, I tried all the settings and I can't imagine why anyone would need to use the Turbo function. I can't see how anyone would use that for regular day to day vacuuming. It's REALLY high intensity. The normal, basic setting is just fine for most floors, rugs and carpets. I think the suction is exceptionally good actually. It's amazing how you think something is clean and then see how much dust and hair gets picked up. 

The pet attachment is handy for small areas that just need a quick clean up. The mop feature is interesting, I probably won't use that one as often. It does work just fine but I just don't like the extra clean-up of the device afterwards. What I really like this for is stairs. It's so much easier to maneuver than a regular vacuum and I can get the corners and angles of the stairs much easier and faster. 

The automatic empty feature is pretty cool but I find that it only completely emptied the dust container about half the time. Even after compressing it and making sure it's not too full. Sometimes there will still be a bit of debris left that has to be manually emptied. However, that was not a big problem for me. I like the compact base station where you can store and charge the vacuum and all the attachments in one place. It's easy to assemble, charge and to set up.

 My main issue is the sensitivity of the vacuum. It reminds me of old smartphones that had the capability to take very high-resolution photos but the phone itself would practically shut down when you used the feature. A lot of high-tech devices have this issue. They design the appliance to be very advanced but, counterintuitively - also too sensitive, so that it requires constant maintenance just to keep it functional on the most basic level. This is a big issue for me because when I clean; I want to get it done quickly and efficiently. I don't like stopping every few minutes and having to check the vacuum because it's saying it's ""blocked"". Only to have to completely disassemble the entire thing to figure out what tiny bit of fluff is supposedly ""blocking"" it. The usual culprit of the ""blockage"" is a tiny dust bunny or some barely visible piece of fluff that I have to spend 5 minutes and a tweezer to find. More times that I like; I had to give up and just use my regular vacuum cleaner to finish my chores. A big deal breaker for me because I don't like having to walk on eggshells around my appliances because I'm not sure if they'll work or allow me to get my tasks done that day without issue. That is my only but most major con.

Other than that; this vacuum is very good for basic tasks and day to day cleaning. Great for stairs and small areas. Good suction and helpful features and attachments."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,31-Aug-22,E1g1n,LOVE," I have never loved a Vacuum more than this one! I have had several upright Vacuums and robot Vacuums over the years, but always tend to quit. I love this is an all in one center with auto dumping features.  The suction on the Vacuum is amazing and the mop is better than my traditional mop. I love all the different types of attachments it comes with and it's cordless. I can use it on my ceiling fans, wall, furniture and floors."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,31-Aug-22,Angelocampo70,Amazing, Received this wonderful product! I have never used something as awesome as this! My wife loves it more! She enjoys cleaning the boarders and the edges! She threw out the out vacuum and made a special place for this!
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,4,31-Aug-22,arb71,Super light and easy to use," I like this vacuum a lot because it is super lightweight and easy to push.  It doesn't hurt my back to vacuum using this vacuum. The fact that it empties itself into the tower is a great feature and so simple. The only downside to this vacuum is that it doesn't really seem to get down into the carpet.  It seems to just glide over the top rather than really do deep cleaning.  Other than that, I love it."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,4,31-Aug-22,Matt Sc,"Quiet, Great Vacuum, Eh Mop, Proprietary Bags"," Wow, I was not expecting so many parts and pieces to arrive in such a large box. After getting over my initial shock, everything was pretty straightforward to put together and all of the components and attachments either store in or hang on the base, so it doesn't take up as much room as I feared.

The vacuum itself is deceptively quiet and works great. We have a similar style stick vacuum from another well known brand and it must be 2-3 times louder than this vacuum, but seems to perform the same. We have a dog that'll dash out the doggy door when our old vacuum turns on. With this vacuum, she's still not pleased, but she'll hang out one room over instead of making a beeline for the backyard.

The vacuum itself comes with a number of attachments-- a general floor head (with spinning brushes) a narrower pet hair head (with spinning rubber flaps) and a mop (no suction, just rotating pads). It also has the usual brush, crevice tool, etc. One cool thing worth mentioning is that the aluminum tube (between the vacuum and head) is extendable, so this is actually comfortable to use while standing-- you don't have to hunch over.

For performance, I find that you can get about 15 minutes out of one battery on the highest speed, but closer to 45 minutes with the lowest speed-- which has more than enough power for hardwood floors, etc. This set also comes with a spare battery (that sits under the lid of the storage tower and is always charged), so you can actually get some cleaning done in between charges.

The general flooring head with the bristles works well-- it picks up pretty much everything. The rubber flap head for pet hair is okay. It does good for hair that is fresh on the surface (so couches, car seats, etc)-- but it does not work miracles. If you have a rug with hair that's worked in over the past 2 years and is really embedded in there, not much will get it out, including this head.

The mop head is a bit of a disappointment. It has a small reservoir, you can't use hot water, and you can only use plain water (no cleaning solutions). Because of this, it's really limited in its usefulness for me.

Finally, the base/storage station is pretty slick. It always keeps the vacuum charged (expected), does a good job at holding all the accessories (good design), but the real feature is the auto emptying of the hand vac. If it's in AUTO mode, as soon as you dock the vacuum, it pops it open, sucks out all the dust and gets it ready to go again. I turned it off of AUTO because it is loud. It's basically as loud as a corded vacuum cleaner when it goes off. Overall, I love it. My only disappointment is that it empties the vacuum into a proprietary LG vacuum bag that they are currently pretty proud of. Hopefully a third party comes out with a more economical choice in the future.

So, final verdict? I love it, it's sleek, works well, is quiet, and is well thought out. Don't buy it for the mop feature (more of a gimmick in my eyes) and do be aware of the ongoing costs of the proprietary bags (though you can manually empty the vac into your own trash can, but that kind of negates the best feature of this system-- the auto emptying), but if you can get past those, then I think you'll really like what LG did with this product."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,3,26-Aug-22,Gina,Just ok,Wasn’t thrilled with it for over a grand. And I really hate to return to a bag system. Surely they could have just made a cup or bin.
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,1,10-Aug-22,Momzof4,Don't do it!,"This is by far the worst vacuum I have ever owned.  It truly does not work, like at all. It barely picks up anything. The turbo mode takes you immediately in a low battery. Seriously the worst choice I have ever made, returning ASAP."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,29-Jul-22,Jeryljam,Loving it, Great product!  Lightweight.  Works great.  Easy to switch attachments.  Also like the mop attachment for my wood and tile floors.  Auto emptying is great feature - so easy.  And charging tower ensures both batteries always ready to go.
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,26-Jul-22,Adele2301,Best vacuum, I’ve had this vacuum for a few months and just love it. My house is so fresh and clean cause there is no dust from the vacuum.
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,4,6-Jul-22,Nicolini,Works good so far," Purchased 20 days ago, arrived with broken mop nozzle, was replaced , nicely built works good way to expensive"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,28-Jun-22,LG CordZero,Looks can Deceiving! In a good way., This Vacuum has exceeded all expectaions we had from a cordless stick vacuum. Very powerful and lightweight. The self cleaning feature in the tower is such a bonus. We use the floor polisher/mop attachment more than we thought we would. Highly recommend this Vacuum to anybody!
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,28-Jun-22,TJSZX2,LG CordZero is my new best friend," The first cordzero I admit did have a slight malfunction so back to went to the store for exchange since it would not empty the vacuum.  The replacement one I received works as advertised and I absolutely love it.  This vacuum stands it ground against the forever shedding of two German Shepherds....has more suction than one would expect a stick vacuum to have, and ove the sleek look of the tower."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,3,28-Jun-22,JTP123,Small disappointment," We use this at least 2 times a day, if not more. Dogs and kids are messy. The only thing I don't like about it is the vacuum attachments don't have the ability to turn off the rotation over hard floors and there are not lights on the vacuum attachments.  The mop has a light, come on LG."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,1,19-Jun-22,tt226,Brand New Unit Came Broken,"I was very happy and excited to open this new product. The concept of this vacuum was different, which had me switch over to LG (coming from owning several Dyson vacuums and other Dyson products). After watching many reviews on this vacuum and seeing other people un-boxing videos. I had high hopes for this product. However, the extension pipe arrived with a dent mark. Another worst thing, the main unit was not sucking up any of the dirt! The dirt bin was completely brand new, even after vacuuming the whole basement. The vacuum powers on (for certain attachments) and off, WI-FI worked and connected to device. The power mode did not work at all. The speed of the vacuum was the same, even when trying to switch it to turbo mode. It's like it has only one mode. The lowest mode possible. With the standard attachment, the brush would spin like normal and managed to pick up some debris from the carpet. As soon as I lift the vacuum up, all the debris fell back on the carpet. When I place my hand near the attachment, I can feel the air flow coming out. I tried all the little attachments, couldn't even get the power to turn on. Both batteries were fully charged. 

I reached out to LG support and the representative suggested to ship the main unit back to them for repairs and diagnostic but it'll take 3-5 days to get the shipping box. Plus an additional 7 days for them to do the repairs. The extension pipe is in for replacement. Honestly, for a product that is this pricey. I'm very disappointed. A vacuum that doesn't even vacuum.... I had zero issue with my other vacuums. You buy a product brand new hoping everything will work properly on the first try. 

Just a very bad experience. Will update the review once the unit is repaired. But so far, I'm not sure how I feel about this product. I can't tell you to skip the hassle and go with another brand. At this moment, that's what I'm leaning towards. But I will give it another try once it's fixed."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,1,1-Jun-22,Jennifer,I have to return it since it will never work...,I have to return it since it will never work nor does anyone want to tell me how to return it
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,14-May-22,Homeowner,Best I've ever owned!,"Easily the best vacuum I've ever purchased. My carpet feels more plush than ever before, it runs for quite a long time, and the storage, charging and auto emptying is nothing short of a blessing. If you get this and are concerned about your floors getting scratched, make sure you take the time to read the manual- it is your responsibility as the owner of the product to use it as recommended. LG got everything a vacuum needs to do and went the extra mile with this thing."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,1,12-May-22,ROGER,Getting ready to take ir back...,Getting ready to take ir back
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,2,29-Apr-22,Syd34,Underwhelming," I bought this vacuum as an investment, I thought it would be a high quality, enjoyable and easy to use. However the suction is extremely weak and to even get to enough power it has to be at the most powerful turbo mode which only lasts for seven minutes on a four hour battery charge. If this is how weak it is now I hate to think how useless it will become once it starts to lose power. The features on this otherwise are both useful and well made so it having so little power is extremely disappointing. Plus the one tiny wheel is not large enough making using this vacuum extremely hard to move on carpet most vacuums pull away from you and are able to pull in dirt surrounding the outside of the tool but this is unable to do either. Finally the feature that allows you to adjust the height is very nice in thought but due to the fact that it often unlocks during use making it shrink and grow with movement makes it irritating and overall more difficult to use. I was extremely disappointed by all of this as I’m usually a fan of lg products as my fridge, washer, dryer, stove, etc. are all lg products. I hope lg is able to improve on this product and bring it to match the higher standard of its other products."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,8-Apr-22,Nichol T,Definitely Worth The Money, I love this vacuum it is worth every penny. I love the different features and specs
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,1,8-Apr-22,Nickiename,Scratched My Floors," I loved the vacuum until it scratched my brand new hardwood floors! It works as expected on carpet, but is not made for hardwood. It took all of a minute to notice that it did not pick up fine dirt/particles well; the longest I could even try due to my floors being scratched. BTW, nothing was trapped in the vacuum. This was fresh out of the box."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,3,21-Feb-22,MStone,Its okay,"I do like the auto dump, however I feel like the suction could be alot better. Also it would be nice to have a light at the front. I have only used this in laminate and tile floors. For the price it coukd becalot better."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,7-Feb-22,Maytrs,Quiet but cleans well!," This LG CordZero vacuum is a lot quieter than my other cordless vacuum but it cleans well. 
The charging stand is my favorite! I usually lose the attachment pieces but this holds almost all of the attachments including the extra battery.
I also love the auto empty feature and the mop feature. I would definitely recommend this to everyone!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,1,12-Jan-22,Angelaemvi,Can’t pick up cereal to save its life,I returned my dyson for this vacuum and it sucks on hard floor. It won’t pick up pieces of cereal it breaks them and pushes them around it’s so frustrating for how expensive it is
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,4,5-Jan-22,RL65,Great Vac!," I like this vacuum alot. I like that the extra tools are hidden in a compartment, I like that you can empty the dust bin on your own or that it empties itself. The only thing I am not a fan of is the mop it leaves streaks on my tiled floor."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,29-Dec-21,DMD210,Love it!, I got the LG Cordzero vacuum about a month ago and I love this vacuum. It cleans so well and the fact that all three attachments tuck neatly into the charging base and are easy to get to makes using it quick and simple.
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,14-Dec-21,Emelee,Best vacuum cleaner I’ve ever had!," I can honestly say this is by far the best vacuum cleaner I’ve ever owned! It is light and very maneuverable. I love how the dock is a charging station, backup battery charger, and self cleaning dock all in one! I really love the suction power that never declines. This is due to the self cleaning dock clearing out all the dirt and dust each time place the vacuum on it. It also comes with a self watering mop attachment which is super useful for my hardwood floors! I very highly recommend this!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,28-Nov-21,JUSTMOM,Love love Love this vacuum!!!," About this LG CordZero Vacuum, I wish I have the ability to write down all the wonderful things about it.  This is an outstanding vacuum no matter the user-friendly design, all the attached accessories, and the performance, all and all, this is the king!
I mostly use a vacuum to clean up our house about twice a week, we have 50% carpet and 50% vinyl floor, with this vacuum I can use it on both surfaces.  
The auto empty charging station is so well-made and very user-friendly, you can store the extra tools inside the station. 
The auto empty design is really impressive!  So convenient and really work perfectly, so after a few weeks, the vacuum still looks brand new!
The filter inside the vacuum is so easy to change or clean, there are so many extra nozzles and tools, all well-designed and high quality.
The most and the best is the owner's manual is so clear and easy to understand. 
Overall I highly recommend this vacuum!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,26-Nov-21,Bbjniles,"Beauty, power and function!"," Wow, wow, wow…this LG CordZero Vacuum is incredible.  It looks so sleek and modern, it holds and hides most of the attachments, it empties itself, and is an absolute workhorse.   This is a great piece of equipment…LG has really outdone itself!

I will say that removing it from the box can be a little intimidating.  There are a lot of wrapped pieces, and a ton of instructions.  That said, it is intuitively built, so assembling everything is a breeze.  The tower opens to reveal cubbies for the three attachments and the brush for occasional cleanings.  There too is the bag that holds the refuse when the vacuum is emptied.  This is behind a door, so when the tower is opened, everything is put away and tidy.

It also comes with a power mop head, though this is very large and will have to be stored separately.  Still, we already had a power mop, so we are actually saving room since we can get rid of it, and only have to store the mop head for the CordZero.

And while we are here, I will say that the mop head works very well, spinning vigorously, and sparing your back, as traditional mopping requires much more elbow grease.  The pads attach using Velcro, and are easily removed and cleaned.  There is a water reservoir and two setting to choose from in terms of wetness.  This head is (as too are all the attachments) easily installed and removed.

The stick portion of the device requires depressing a sliding button to choose your desired length, so it works well for those of most heights.  

There is a power bottom on the handle, which is great for those with weak hands or aching joints.  Many stick vacuums require you to hold a trigger down, which can be difficult and annoying, but not so with the CordZero.  There are three settings, the lowest being fine for most all the time.  The battery lasts around an hour, though that varies whether we are using it on our wood floors or carpets.  The top setting eats the battery quickly, so we rarely use it.  Still, it comes with two batteries, one of which charges in a cubby at the top of the tower while not in use, and you are meant to trade them with each run (as they will, according to the instructions, lose their ability to hold a charge over time).  We haven’t experienced reduced battery yet, so I can’t comment on that.  The batteries seat nicely in both the vacuum and tower.

This thing really is a marvel to look at, especially considering it’s a vacuum.  The tower is spare and modern, casting minimalistic lines, and not drawing undue attention, but fitting in well.  This is great for us, as we don’t have a closet with an outlet inside, so the CordZero has to stay out in a room.  I imagine this is true for many people, so that fact that it looks so clean is a huge plus…it doesn’t clutter up your space, but instead blends into it.

The vacuum does feel a bit heavier that precious stick vacuums we’ve owned, but none are as feature robust, and most are corded so you can’t free range your home with them.  It is quite loud when you place it in the tower and it empties itself, but it only lasts a few seconds, so it doesn’t cause much distraction.  Too, this certainly has more power than I expected, so kudos to LG for that.

We really are over the moon with the CordZero…it can do everything, so were able to declutter by removing  an old corded stick vacuum, and a corded power mop.  And we can do it in high style.  

From the aesthetics to the functionality, the LG CordZero is top notch, and I really couldn’t recommend it highly enough!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,26-Nov-21,LalaT,Game changer!," I LOVE this product. It is lightweight and the head swivels really sleekly to get those corners and hard to reach areas. I really love that is cordless so no more fighting the cord being in the way and switching outlets to get the job done. Works well on hardwoods, tile, carpet and area rugs. I love how the attachments store in the stand so they won't get lost. Also the self emptying is so cool. My husband is looking forward to using it to vacuum out his truck since it can also be a hand vac. I cannot recommend this enough! It makes vacuuming fun and my kids actually WANT to vacuum. That alone makes it worth every penny!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,24-Nov-21,huntersgrandma,Love This !!!!," I got the LG CordZero Vacuum a few weeks ago, and I love it!! Where to begin, first super easy to assemble, and then just put it in a corner for easy access!! This vacuum is awesome, it is not only a great vacuum, but a mop too!! It cleans super well, and even dog hair, which is great when you have dogs like me!! You can even download an app to connect to your wi-fi!! It can empty into your charging station so your are not emptying after every use!! It is so well made and its just all around an awesome vacuum/mop!! I would very highly recommend this vacuum to everyone!!!!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,23-Nov-21,Thatdad86,Amazing!," This is a great vac. The battery life is good, it lasts a long time, especially if you make sure to charge after each use. This vacuum picks up like a champ. We have 2 cats and a dog so we have a lot of pet hair. This picks it all up!! Crumbs, gone, cat hair, gone! Easy to use and super easy to set up. It is extremely easy to pick up and handle."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,16-Nov-21,RaleighNCGuy,Awesome Vacuum!," We love this vacuum so much! The vacuum is really powerful, especially using the turbo mode. It is so convenient to have a vacuum like this around the house. It’s really great to not have a cord to drag around! One of the coolest features is the self-emptying tower. The self-emptying feature is very powerful and works really well. The tower also has very handy built-in storage for the vacuum attachments, and the overall footprint is pretty compact. Overall, this is a really nice vacuum system and we are very happy with it!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,15-Nov-21,Adolin,Good vacuum, This thing is so cool it boxed up perfectly the vacuum itself has some really cool features like it has a little thing on if it scraped off the filter it’s really cool the functionality is awesome it comes with two batteries this is a really really cool vacuum even though the the extension on it is really easy to use. It works great. This thing has all the attachments you would need including a wet mop attachment! The tower is super cool! It sucks the dirt out of the vacuum for you. Very cool vacuum!
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,15-Nov-21,MegBrit,Absolutely Amazing!," Let me start off by saying this is the absolute best vacuum by far. My husband was skeptical that a cordless vacuum could clean our carpets better than a traditional plug-in vacuum. He vacuumed our bedroom with the other vacuum (a very expensive and highly rated). When he was done, I took the LG CordZero and went back over the carpet. Wow! I got quite a bit in the canister. My husband was impressed. I also love that the stand has self-cleaning. The dust that you typically have to deal with is non-existent when emptying out. I am so thrilled with this vacuum. I have not yet had the opportunity to use the mop feature on our hardwoods. I cannot believe I’m about to say this, but I cannot wait to mop my floors! Do yourself a favor, and go ahead and purchase the LG CordZero."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,14-Nov-21,MeganM33,Best vacuum I've ever used," WOW! This LG cordzero blows away any Dyson I've ever had (I've had 3 models) and the Shark that I most recently started using. It is quieter, the auto empty feature is downright amazing, and it has a perfect amount of power to pick up the hair from my 2 dogs plus all the grass clippings that inevitably get tracked into the house. 

I haven't even tried the mopping option yet, but I am sure it's amazing as well. 

I will say that the amount of instructions that come with this device are plentiful - so many different instruction booklets and cards made it a little confusing but I guess when it comes to directions for a new device, more is better than less. 

I love how this vacuum is small enough to fit under furniture, like beds, to clean. Also it's sleek appearance has me not even minding that it sits out in the living room! It does have to be plugged in so it can charge - which makes storing it in a closet difficult. But it's so nice looking that it doesn't even matter. 

I recommend this over and over - I am geeky excited to have this new vacuum in my arsenal!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,13-Nov-21,Anonymous19,Best Vacuum Ever," Lightweight, heavy suction, fairly quiet, powerful and has so many great accessories. Love the cordless aspect and batteries run long enough for entire house to be cleaned. Auto empty into bag is awesome! Storage ""tower"" is pretty compact and doesn't take up too much space (huge bonus). Great for vacuuming stairs and, as dog owners, all the furniture that attracts pet hair."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,11-Nov-21,Tonape,Highly efficient cordless stick Vaccum cleaner wit," Aesthetically it has all features to get good hold of this stick vacuum cleaner. Its very light in weight and very easy to maneuver. This stick has inbuilt feature to adjust the height which is pretty cool. Its much quieter than traditional heavy duty vacuum cleaner but little nosier than its competitor. 
Vacuum cleaner is highly efficient in cleaning the floor. Highly effective on every thickness of the carpet. If small carpets roll in the vacuum cleaner, just stop the vacuums cleaner and it easily comes off.  It works just fine. Smooth in operation. Mop feature is also highly effective. Battery life is pretty good. It comes with spare battery so no issue of running out of juice. Really impressed with its aesthetic.
Tower is designed just to the perfection. Its compact in nature. Looks good. It can accommodate attachments which was impressive. (which helps a lot in our case) Emptying the vacuum cleaner in auto mode is absolutely easy, just hang it up and it will job for you. No mess at all. This tower can charge both batteries at a time including one installed in the cleaner. 
This is impressive setup and clean way to use the vacuum. Highly recommended."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,10-Nov-21,JennUNC123,Modern day cleaning system!," The LG Cord Zero All-in-One Tower is not your standard stick vacuum, it's an entire cleaning system tucked away inside a modern piece of art!  Even before I used the cordless stick vacuum to clean my home, I instantly felt that my house improved a few notches by having this fancy and extra sleek all-in-one tower displayed proudly in my laundry room.  Not only does it it look beautiful, but it holds a myriad of tools and accessories that can be used to clean just about everything in your home. The suction of the vacuum is fantastic and the battery charge lasts for a very long time. An extra battery is included, but I haven't found it necessary since the charge hold is more than sufficient. The Vacuum itself is very light and it's easy to maneuver. 

All of the six tools included in the tower have come in handy, but I especially love the  mop nozzle option.  It is super easy to use and only requires water while getting your tile and hardwoods spotless!  
Another favorite feature of the LG CordZero is that the vacuum is cordless so you don't have to worry about getting tangled up in cords. Not having to constantly rearrange cords makes along with not having to find outlets to replug as you move through your home makes cleaning a lot less daunting. Lastly, the vacuum automatically clears the dust and dirt into a collection bag within the tower so you can don't have to ""clean up after you clean up""! I would definitely recommend the LG CordZero All-in-One tower to everyone, but especially for those who love to use all the latest and greatest technology and innovative products."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,4,19-Oct-21,jerman2000,Great System! Great Vacuum! Mop is just okay.," This setup is fantastic!  The battery life on this vacuum/mop is outstanding.  I can pretty much vacuum the whole downstairs of our home, then use the mop head before the battery will die.  It's incredible.  The extra battery is very handy when you run out of power on the first one.  The vacuum is very powerful, easy to use, very light weight, and surprisingly quiet.  The mop takes a little getting used to.  It doesn't use a lot of water, which is and it dries quickly.  You don't put any cleaner in the reservoir (just water), which makes it good for the occasional cleaning, but I don't think it would replace traditional mopping and a thorough cleaning.  I don't think it has the power to clean up a significant mess.   The base station/dust cleaner vacuum is very cool, but you need to make sure and empty the bin on the vacuum before you put it back on the base station.  The base station vacuum is only to clean up dust in the primary vacuum.  I made the mistake of not emptying the bin and had to clean out dog hair in the entire vacuum (user error on my part).  Overall, this is a really neat setup.  Understanding how everything works now, I really like it and would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a wireless vacuum system."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,11-Oct-21,Dgg123,Best vacuum ever, This is the coolest vacuum ever it does everything including my tile floors. And on top of all that it empty’s it’s self. And it’s so easy to you and with not having a cord you get into places that don’t usually get touched all the time. Picks up dog hair great. I just love this vacuum you can just take off charger and do quick pick up.
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,6-Oct-21,wocket,Love this vacuum!," This is my first wireless vacuum after a life of corded uprights. I can't believe how great it is - if I see dirt or a ball of dust - just grab the vacuum off the rechargeable stand, vacuum it up and return it. No more unwinding the cord, vacuuming, then winding it back up. Also - if you are used to a corded vacuum like me - this one is so light! Vacuuming stairs has never been easier (or safer in my opinion). It has a spare battery if you have a lot of cleaning to do. I have not needed it yet. The suction on it is great and it is very easy to steer around corners. A great vacuum indeed!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,5-Oct-21,suckitup87,The most amazing thing!," I have to say I was blown away by this product. I didn't expect to love it so much, but LG went above and beyond to make this easy for the buyer, and effortless for cleaning. This is likely the best purchase I've made this year."
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,4-Oct-21,Skincaid87,Perfection," I am obsessed with this vacuum the two recharging batteries, the self cleaning on its on makes it worth it alone. Easy to use and great on all surfaces.
Light weight, doesn’t require lots of space, this is the all time best vacuum I have ever had!!"
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,3-Oct-21,Bennysmom,Great Stick Vaccum, I’m so in love with my LG Cord stiick vacuum with charging station.It has such a powerful suction.It’s light weight but so durable .It empty’s it’s self in a container .It has a charging station which is awesome.This is the best Vacuum i’ve ever had .It’s amazing .
homedepot,LG A939KBGS,5,2-Oct-21,NC_Ken,Wow," It’s quiet and powerful and in a household with 2 kids and a dog, we need both. The adjustable length is huge, too, because it’s comfortable for everyone in the house to use. And can we talk about the fact that the vacuum empties itself when it’s on the charging dock? Wow. Game changer."
