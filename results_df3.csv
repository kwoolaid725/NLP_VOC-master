another super cool feature is the standmount its very sturdy and can charge the extra battery at the same time the battery in the vacuum charges it makes a cool sound when you dock the vacuum to let you know its in all the way you dont have to drill into your wall with this standmount lastly the thinq app wifi connectivity is not necessary but its cool to see that it can help diagnose any issues has helpful info on cleaning the filters as well as when to clean them connecting to the app has another cool feature that can notify you when the vacuum is fully charged so you dont have to keep checking on it if you are waiting to finish vacuuming it comes with 2 batteries and on the low and medium settings it can last from 4060ish minutes on one battery on the turbo setting about 78 minutes per baattery my only gripe with this vacuum is that it can be a little hard to push over carpet however the carpet comes out very clean and i see that its able to get very fine dust from the carpet as well no tangles or difficulty picking up my dogs hair 2 huskies the wand is extendable which is convenient i highly recommend this vacuum another thing i like over the dyson stick vacuums is that you just press a button to turn it on theres no trigger you have to continuously hold like the dyson stick vacuums this vacuum does feel a little heavy if youre holding it up for cleaning above head areas but its not that bad","['hands another super cool feature', 'thinq app wifi connectivity', 'dogs hair 2 huskies', '78 minutes per baattery', 'another cool feature', 'well built especially', 'havent seen elsewhere', 'dyson stick vacuums', 'continuously hold like', 'vacuum another thing', 'vacuum feels sturdy', 'also helps push', 'dust mite allergy', '4060ish minutes', '2 batteries', 'pretty cool', 'cool sound', 'cool features', 'vacuum charges', 'one thing', 'helps reduce', 'fine dust', 'aafa allergy', 'youre holding', 'turbo setting', 'try since', 'toylike dysons', 'standmount lastly', 'sealed system', 'really brilliant', 'one battery', 'medium settings', 'little heavy', 'little hard', 'lg washer', 'kompressor tech', 'keep checking', 'highly recommend', 'helpful info', 'help diagnose', 'head areas', 'fully charged', 'finish vacuuming', 'extra battery', 'difficulty picking', 'crevice tool', 'creakyflimsy plastic', 'carpet however', 'carpet comes', 'bin contents', 'asthma certified']","['love', 'decided', 'give', 'try', 'since', 'lg', 'washer', 'dryer', 'cool', 'features', 'havent', 'seen', 'elsewhere', 'vacuum', 'feels', 'sturdy', 'well', 'built', 'especially', 'comparing', 'cheap', 'toylike', 'dysons', 'feel', 'sound', 'creakyflimsy', 'plastic', 'aafa', 'allergy', 'asthma', 'certified', 'sealed', 'system', 'important', 'dust', 'mite', 'kompressor', 'tech', 'pretty', 'helps', 'reduce', 'often', 'empty', 'bin', 'also', 'push', 'contents', 'dont', 'touch', 'one', 'thing', 'think', 'really', 'brilliant', 'use', 'crevice', 'tool', 'remove', 'clean', 'cyclone', 'means', 'reach', 'grab', 'dirty', 'hands', 'another', 'super', 'feature', 'standmount', 'charge', 'extra', 'battery', 'time', 'charges', 'makes', 'dock', 'let', 'know', 'way', 'drill', 'wall', 'lastly', 'thinq', 'app', 'wifi', 'connectivity', 'necessary', 'see', 'help', 'diagnose', 'issues', 'helpful', 'info', 'cleaning', 'filters', 'connecting', 'notify', 'fully', 'charged', 'keep', 'checking', 'waiting', 'finish', 'vacuuming', 'comes', '2', 'batteries', 'low', 'medium', 'settings', 'last', '4060ish', 'minutes', 'turbo', 'setting', '78', 'per', 'baattery', 'gripe', 'little', 'hard', 'carpet', 'however', 'able', 'get', 'fine', 'tangles', 'difficulty', 'picking', 'dogs', 'hair', 'huskies', 'wand', 'extendable', 'convenient', 'highly', 'recommend', 'like', 'dyson', 'stick', 'vacuums', 'press', 'button', 'turn', 'theres', 'trigger', 'continuously', 'hold', 'heavy', 'youre', 'holding', 'head', 'areas', 'bad']"

927,0.00777592,0.08358626,0.9086378,341,5,"powerful vacuum that empties itself i was very impressed with the functionality of this vacuum system there are two parts the cordless stick vacuum and the power base the vacuum proved to be very powerful in cleaning about 1200 square feet of carpet on the turbo setting and still had plenty of charge left this system came with two batteries it is important to state one battery charges in the base power unit to be ready when needed and the other battery will also charge when the stick vacuum is docked on the base unit very smart design point these 26 volt batteries provide a lot more suction power than the usual 14 to 18 volt systems and proved long lasting as well
after vacuuming 1200 square feet i noticed that the dust bin on the stick vacuum had about 3 inches of hair and dust particles i had just used another cordless stick vacuum the day before for the same area so this test definitely showed the lg vacuum power was far superior 
the power base unit has its own vacuum setup to suck out the stick vac’s dustbin into a dust bag housed in the power base unit i can confirm that the 3 inches of pet hair and dust was removed into the base unit see my before and after photos when i looked at the stick vac’s dust bin not only was all the debris gone but it appeared the inside of the dust bin had been wiped clean – great system and a tip of the cap to the lg engineering team you will notice that when the base unit cleans the stick vacuum dust bin it actually opens the bottom plate on the dustbin and closes it again when the cycle is completed – i love that kind of engineering the whole system has solid quality and is very well designed
the system included a very complete set of accessories that included a small cleaning brush which was very handy for cleaning filters a crevice tool a combo brush and suction head that was great for cleaning car floors a vacuum head with moving rollerbrush for carpet a mop head 2 spinning discshaped mops with liquid chamber and a pet nozzle for furniture and other areas wow a lot of uses covered all these accessories store in the power base unit
if all these features aren’t enough the unit connects to your home’s wifi system now using your cellphone you can monitor activity of this vacuum system i initially thought the wifi control button was on the base unit but it is on the stick vacuum and is labelled the unit easily connected to the wifi – you must use a 24 ghz access point
i did also run the included mop head to clean my kitchen and bathroom floors easy job but be sure to wash the mop heads by hand after each use it’s easier to dry the mop heads in a dryer but don’t put the heads in a washing machine

unboxing and setup
everything was well packed and secure  straightforward and intuitive to set up remove everything from the box and you will see how everything fits together once you put the stand on the floor i want to mention that it was a pretty heavy box at around 50lbs  for some this may be a team lift so plan accordingly once you place your stand but all the accessories inside the tower and admire your work everything looks so lovely in that corner now doesnt it this has smart connectivity but i chose not to use it after it only supports 24ghz networks… really we are in 2022 and we still only support 24ghz wifi
 
performance and differentiators
the most wonderful feature here on this vacuum is the simple use of an onoff switch no more holding a trigger  press once and you are good to go until you are finished the inclusion of the electric mop is nice and offers added value and cleaning power for your arsenal lg is changing the game here rather than copying the granddaddy of vacuums the telescoping wand allows reconfiguration to compensate for differences in cleaning areas and user heights the spare battery lives in a charging station just under the lid that you can quickly remove if necessary the electric mop offers a floor scrubbing solution but isnt complete because it cant vacuum up like a dedicated electric mop to leave your floor streakfree this is meant to be an agitator and doesnt suck up dirty water from the floor think a swiffer with motorized scrubbers and then an airdry with whats left on the surface
 
build quality and battery life
the lg cordlesszero has just an okay build almost entirely plastic build with beautiful minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing stand that will blend into any decor i worry for those who drop their vacuum a lot of bang into things with all the plastic here the attachments are all plastic with the electric mop having metal now lets talk battery life here i tested on the carpet with carpet head i got about 35 mins on medium  power probably could go a bit longer but i finished when set on turbo and you get maybe 10 mins and on normal you get around an hour i have never run out of battery yet during a cleaning session taking care of 3 levels with stairs and carpets in my 2500 sq ft place here are the specs straight from lgs website pertaining to the battery life for normal handy120min power handy60min turbo handy14min with floor wand normal stick80min power stick40min turbo stick12min
 
here is a quick list of my things that make this vacuum excellent and some things i wish were thought through again hopefully these things can be addressed in future renditions 
 
love
onoff switch  no more trigger pulling for long sessions
portable power  its great for auto cleaning and quick cleanups i take it to the office to touch up the desk and take it home
lightweight in the hand  you can clean for a while as fatigue is reduced due to design and weight
kompressor button  being able to touch the stuff in the canister without touching it is nice
tower stand  completely selfcontained in a minimalist stand no need to wall mount a charger
2 batteries  two batteries provided with one stored and charged so it is always ready for a swap
quieter  it is quiet but the performance suffers as well run this on medium for better cleaning and it still is quiet compared to other vacuums i tried
3 step hepa filtration  clean breathable air for those with allergies and who dont like to empty the bin
 
cmon man
24ghz wifi networks only  only supports 24ghz networks… really we are in 2022 and we only support 24ghz wifi
power button placement  often you can press it by just walking around with it or placing it on the dock
maintenance  with all the features there is maintenance you need to maintain filters in the tower the selfemptying part and the hand unit
deep cleaning performance  things sometimes dont get sucked up in one pass with minimal improvement in turbo mode larger cereal isnt easily vacuumed
turbo mode activation  it takes forever to activate it feels longer than 3 seconds but sheesh
no auto suction mode  highly disappointing to a vacuum in this range
no onwand clip for attachments
battery indicator  no timer useful with remaining battery life old style 3 bar battery for you to guess from minutes left would be more valuable as the rest of the pack provides these days
tiny dust bin capacity  300ml which is 40 smaller than competitors
nonremovable bin  you cannot separate the container from the handle to clean like competitors
exhaust position  while using you will get exhaust in your face use this on your stairs or anywhere you have the vacuum below your face and enjoy a blast of hot air i slightly angle the handle and it helps a little
plasticky build  everything from the tube to the vacuum itself and its accessories are plastic i hope you arent rough and bang into furniture or walls after a few drops with the wand attached i dont see this lasting 
battery life  isnt that great compared to others in the market but you get two so it is not as bad 
roller drags  compared to other vacuums used on carpet the head has a significant drag and pressure when going through medium shag rugs it often digs into the carpet and you have to push to regain control

1007,0.29824802,0.43535367,0.2663983,384,3,"expensive featurerich with mediocre performance the lg cordzero “allinone” system is an interesting and expensive idea that tries to accomplish all things you’d expect from vacuum cleaners the package includes most of the items i’d usually need for everyday use and the impressive base station though being quite large and hefty is feature rich the attachments are good and so is the ergonomics it is a truly multifunctional tool
the stick vacuum itself is well designed and wellbalanced the motor near the top end is very compact for its power and the telescopic handle makes it very easy to use after using it to vacuum carpets and some tile floors i didn’t feel much fatigue compared to my other stick vacuums the roller head universal nozzle can move around to reach a lot of hard to reach places however with “normal” operation i felt the suction power is not that great  with my “moderately clean” carpets with the usual dog hair etc i frequently switched to the “power” mode and a few times to the “turbo” mode this drastically reduced the battery life and had to swap out the provided 2nd battery almost all the time without the 2nd battery and the charging station this would have been a nogo from the very start of course this depends on what type of carpets you have and how dirty they regularly get but for me i’d appreciate it a bit more under normal mode but this is a drawback for almost all cordless vacuums i have used so far the highlytouted kompressor technology is just a manual lever that pushes down the debris inside dust bin this helps pack more dust before i need emptying but more me looked like an overhyped idea one thing to point out that the package does not include the slim hardfloor nozzle so maybe that would be a better head to use for noncarpeted areas however i did not have the means to try that out
as for the mop nozzle  i have to say i’m quite disappointed with it only water can be used as the cleaning fluid and the speed is fixed this made it almost ineffective if there’s a speck of dirt in my tiled floor for my use case it was an ultralowduty attachment and would only be useful if i could use it every single day it is very very limited in its use so if you plan to use it be wary
the other “powered” head is the pet nozzle which lists a lot of limitations in the manual it can’t be used with clothing bedding leather sofas cushions carpet vinyl flooring tiles marble which made me wary to use it all there are also crevice tools and a combination tool crevice and brush included as well which are very handy using these heads without the telescopic handle effectively transforms this into a handheld vacuum that i used to clean my car interior
the chargingbase station as i mentioned earlier is quite big and heavy lf provides a plastic base with rubber feet to keep it standing and mounting kit is there to tether it to a wall if needed i did not have an issue with it as long it was not in a hightraffic area the station along with housing the stick vacuum can charge the included extra battery and has nifty ways to organize the toolsheads the star feature is the autoempty functionality that automatically cleans out the dust bin from the vacuum body and puts it into a removable dust bag i found the feature to be very useful especially when i’m feeling lazy and wanted to create as little mess as possible albeit noisy by default the station performs this auto empty procedure every time the vacuum is docked but this can be changed easily the only drawback i saw was that the dust bag fills up quite easily and i’ll run out of those only 3 are included soon
in terms of ease of use and smart featuresi consider myself a techsavvy person and am always looking forward to trying out new techs but this vacuum left me baffled a number of times for the first few days i had to get the user manual to figure out what needs to be done that’s the price you pay for getting a “feature” rich machine but in my opinion this may leave people a bit frustrated the lg thingq app does not add a lot of functionality  it can store cleaning history and can perform “smart diagnosis” but since i haven’t faced any functional issues with it i can’t comment how well it can actually solve problems
overall i like the lg cordzero allinone system for trying to be an allinone solution but i wish for the price i was getting a bit more performance if you have a lightduty need this will be a very good solution but given the price you have to really think about the pros and cons this could have been great with the large featureset but its mediocre performance made it more gimmicky for my

straight forward setting up the unit is fairly easy but i’d highly suggest reading the manual there are a lot of things i would have missed if i had not read the manual the charging base station is pretty much already assembled out of the box the only labor involved for the base station is placing the gaskets on the bottom of the base plate and setting the charing base station onto the base plate the vacuum does a fairly decent job on the different floors i used it on it did ok on carpet but i felt it could use a bit more power this was even after i cracked it up to power mode and then to turbo mode i was able to use it to clean dirt and debris from my hardwood floors i was a bit nervous using it on my hardwood floors because i only have the universal floor nozzle i had some debris that got caught underneath the nozzle and slightly scratched an area of my hardwood floors perhaps i may look into getting the slim hard floor nozzle that didn’t come with the unit i have after i vacuumed the hardwood floors i then used the mop pads to clean them the water reservoir isn’t as large as a floor cleaner i own by a different manufacturer i assumed i would have to fill it up a few times while mopping the floors i was wrong and it was enough to clean all of the hardwood floors and tile floors it did a good job of disbursing the right amount of water there’s a button to adjust the amount of water you want disbursed while mopping the floors the mop pads turn in a circular direction which you cannot adjust the speed at which they spin the mop nozzle also comes with led lights on the front that illuminate onto the floor while in use the charging base station has a nice feature of automatically emptying the debris from the vacuum into a dust bag once the bag becomes full overtime it will have to be disgarded there’s no way to empty the bags and reuse them because they have a plastic slide rail attached to the top of each bag i wish the bags were reusable or if they could have used a plastic bin that can be emptied over time the price of buying new bags might be costly i empty most of the debris manually from the vacuum itself into a regular trash can before placing it on the base station the charging base station comes in auto mode to empty the vacuum when placing in on the base station this can become quite annoying because every time i place the vacuum on the charging station it goes into the bag empty mode which is quite loud i’ve now switched it to manual mode by pressing the select mode button on top of the base station now when i place the vacuum on the base station to charge i don’t have to worry about it going into the bag empty mode you also can’t remove the vacuum from the base station until it goes through the complete cycle with it being in manual mode now i don’t have to worry about that anymore the vacuum also comes with an app that allows you to see the charging status vacuum history and other useful information it was a bit tricky setting it up i scanned the qr code on that’s located on the vacuum it automatically took me to the app store where i was able to download the app once i was able to open the app it then asked me to create an account locating my vacuum was easy i scanned the same qr code again using the app by using the app to scan the qr code it now adds the vacuum to your account the tricky pars was setting up the wifi you have connect to the vacuum’s built in wifi when it asks for a password you have to type the last 4 characters of the wifi name of your device twice with no spaces after that then the wifi process is complete overall i’m pleased with the vacuum with the power being slightly lower than what i expected it has other features that make up for it it’s still a bit on the pricey

the mop function on the other hand is awful really dont waste the extra hundred dollars for this particular version the water cant be controlled and just slowly drips out per the manual it only uses plain water so no soapy solutions to get the floors really clean 
the one time we used the mop function the spin head on the vacuum part stopped working the next time we tried to use it i dont think it was related but we did have to return the unit for a replacement as a result 
the kompressor feature is nice to push down pet hair and results in having to empty it less often but sometimes pet hair gets stuck on the other side when that happens more gets caught up there until you take the whole inside apart and clean it out 
battery life is acceptable and i can usually get about 800 square feet of carpet on the second setting before one battery runs out on the most powerful setting though i can maybe get a full bedroom before it runs out the extra battery it includes is a bonus also the stand works great and has a spot to charge the spare battery when you arent using it

1884,0.050015282,0.25784943,0.69213533,942,5,the new standard of handheld vacuums having used hand held vacuums for quite some time from a multitude of different manufacturers i like to think i have a pretty good grasp on what works well and what doesnt ive used both the high dollar expensive brands and the cheap no names in most cases each has its own benefit and downfall upon receipt of the lg a907gms unit unboxing it found it packed extremely well and thought out assembly was simple each attachment has its own home on the stand i did get every attachment they offer and there was one attachment left without a home that ultimately stays next to the stand however i dont really think thats a knock against them as i have a couple of attachments that could be considered redundant the appearance of the product is excellent it looks very space age with well engineered design the buttons are set into the handle and well labeled attachments have a solid mounting design to keep them in place the stand is weighted for stand alone use i use the stand alone stand mine is not wall mounted upon initial use it took only seconds to figure out the proper functions without the use of a manual the ability to turn up and down the suction allows you to conserve battery life something few handhelds offer it also has the boost option for ultimate suction if needed in hard to reach or heavily soiled areas the bin is a work of art and you can see everything you are sucking up and watch it spin around in a cyclonic action i have noticed that the lg manages to keep the dirt and debris at the bottom of the bin whereas in others the dirt would get up to the top and get stuck in the bin requiring one to use a pencil or the like to get the debris out the battery life is fantastic and it came with a spare battery as well the spare charges in the stand at the same time as the handheld all of the attachments serve a dedicated purpose the big floor head works wonderful the extension housing design was a great idea and is light years beyond having an attachment tube to do the same job the unit has plenty of power and when utilizing the boost feature it has immense suction in todays world of questionable quality and design the lg sets the standard for handheld vacuums once you get one of these youll wonder why you waited so long and your big vacuum will be relegated to the

2277,0.028691888,0.11463468,0.8566734,1170,4,love this lg cordzero vaccuum i have recently gotten the lg electronics cordzero vaccuum and love so many things about this handy device the vacuum came with so many assorted attachments including one for pet hair and a mopping attachment it also came with an extra battery which i love the run time on one battery is a little over an hour if i keep it in auto mode and dont switch to turbo i love having that extra battery on hand and charged up the tower when i need it one unique feature about the cordzero is that its handy base recharges it stores the extra parts battery and attachments as well as has an auto empty feature for cleaning out the debris from the vacuum dust bin i love that is takes one more clean up step out of my normal routine the tower is makes keeping all of the extra things that can be used with the vacuum so nice and tidy and in one spot for easy access the vacuum is lightweight and the main attachment is easy to get around and under furniture i like that the main attachment head is a bit smaller than some of the others ive seen as it can really get into tight spaces and under chairs i love that when i turn it on i dont have to keep holding down on a button to keep the suction going as ive had to do on vacuums ive had in the past it does seamlessly from my hardwood to my tile to my carpet rugs and has a great turbo mode that can be turned on for those places i worry have extra hard to reach dirt the cordzero even has ap app that you can connect to that will show you run times extra info on the troubleshooting and battery life i think one of the super exciting things about the cordzero is that it has a mop attachment although this feature didnt live up to my expectations ill thrilled of the idea of a vacuummop combo the mop attachment has a place to put in water and it has little round pads that velcro on to the vacuum and spin around once you start it up you can control the amount of water that comes out it has a low to high setting but the problem i had was that i didnt think it really mopped my floor there was moisture but it cant be used with soap or cleaner of any kind and i just dont feel like my floor are properly mopped  with just a slight layer of water i used the microfiber mop heads for about 15 minutes on my tile while i was trying out the mopping feature and once done the mop heads were already frazzled and looked to be coming undone i love the idea of the mop combo but in my ideal world it would have been able to be used with a cleaner to really get it good and clean and i would have more function in the amount of water that comes out  i couldnt tell much difference in the low or high adjustments on the mop attachment also the suction is turned off when you use the mop attachment and i would love to see a function added to be able to use the mop with water and cleaner and then have it sucked back up or go back over the water with a drying function again i love the idea but feel like the mop attachment could have some improvement to make it a 5 star product i do like that the mop attachment has a little blue light that shines to help show you where the water is on the floor overall i am thrilled with the uniqueness and creativity that this lg cordzero vacuum brings to my home the tower with its multitude of functions is a real game changer
