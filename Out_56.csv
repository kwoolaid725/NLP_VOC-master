192,I already had the ThinQ app installed on my LG smartphone Nevertheless it required a few attempts to finally connect the vacuum with the app via wifi The CordZero communicates only on 24GHz wifi

200,I believe that you will be just as thoroughly pleased and satisfied with the excellent CordZero A925 Kompressor stick vacuum as we are with ours
201,Highly portable yet powerful stick vacuum The LG CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum is a great looking relatively light vacuum cleaner which fits in nicely between our existing corded and robot vacuum...

215,LG CordZero A925KSM Cordless Stick Is A STANDOUT This LG Cord Zero cordless stick vacuum with Kompressor technology comes with two batteries for extended run time and a clever dirt squisher
216,Kompressor technology is a clever builtin feature that compresses the dirt in the dust bin so it does not need to be emptied as often Moving a lever is all it takes to squish the bin contents
217,Get up to 120 minutes of uninterrupted performance with a pair of included batteries These batteries are said to be an upgraded lithiumion design that can take repeated charges and discharges and ...
218,A portable charging stand is provided that holds the CordZero in place and does not require holes to be drilled into a wall though wall mounting is an option
219,Onetouch controls turn the vacuum on and off and adjust power levels up to Turbo mode with just a thumb This should prove to be less strenuous on the hand
220,Telescope the wand for greater flexibility and to more conveniently store the unit away while taking up less space
221,Removable and washable filters extend the life of the vacuum In addition the cyclone system is removable and washable
222,A Smart Inverter Motor creates powerful suction and is backed by a 10year limited warranty the motor not the batteries
223,The ThinQ app for iOS and Android allows users to check on the vacuum’s cleaning history and perform product diagnostics
224,Convertible from a stick to a hand vac clean floors furniture and vehicle interiors Use the included Universal Power Nozzle when in hand vac mode

234,Easy to empty and the simple washable filter is very effective There are no consumables to deal with on a regular basis though the filters will degrade over time The batteries will eventually need...
235,The brush head is easy to dismantle for removal of anything wrapped around the brush A quarterturn of the red screw on the bottom releases the cover for brush head access
236,There have been no clogs to remove
237,The WiFienabled ThinQ App’s monitoring shows a detailed cleaning history and other stats but is in my mind a feature that is not so important or relevant to this reviewer
238,Everyone here is pretty impressed with this LG CordZero

372,My absolute favorite part of this vacuum is the fact that the top can come off to become a hand vacuum The added attachment for furniture or pet hair however you want to see it is nothing short of...
373,Suction and pick up have been fantastic both on my low pile carpet and tile flooring
374,Overall I like this vacuum significantly more than my corded Dyson It is 100 easier to use ergonomically better and userfriendly I will be interested to see how it stands up over time once the fil...
375,While the Kompressor Technology may not necessarily be worth the extra cost I did purchase the model with this option and have to say it is kind of cool If the extra cost isn’t a huge factor for y...
376,Attached is a photo of vacuuming I did today and last night after seven days of vacuuming every day I am so happy to know that this vacuum will give me a cleaner home when I am keeping my screen d...

378,Perfect Vaccuum For Townhomes Ive been wanting a stick vacuum for years I was dead set on a Dyson because it is one of if not the best vacuum brands However when I went looking during black Friday...
379,Small but mighty Super impressed with this vacuum Initially going into using this I assumed this would be more of a secondary vacuum for me to use for quick surface vacuuming But by the end of the...
380,Initial setup of the vacuum was easy LG provides a quick short cut set of directions to get everything set up in the included Maintenance Guide I love that this vacuum comes with a second battery ...
381,The vacuum itself is sleek in design and super light The telescopic wand is adjustable to a bunch of different lengths which makes the vacuum very versatile The two nozzles and three vacuum access...
382,After letting the batteries charge fully I first tried out my new vacuum on the hardwood floors in my house and the first thing I immediately noticed with this vacuum was how quiet it is – it’s un...
383,Emptying the canister is oddly satisfying and the Kompressor feature makes it conveniently easy to dispense the contents into the trash I really appreciate this feature on the canister since the c...

385,Last after being unexpectedly impressed by the power of this vacuum I decided to test using this vacuum for all of my carpeted rooms in the house on the Turbo mode Not only was I able to vacuum al...
386,Overall this vacuum is extremely impressive It is very versatile in use and shockingly powerful for its size but very quiet Its easy to handle and very light weight and between the longevity of th...
387,Better than a Dyson Ive been using the LG CordZero for about two weeks to clean up various daytoday messes that occur with two young kids Overall this is a good alternative to the Dyson V7 that I ...
388,Pros  \nThe comfort of the handle and not having to constantly squeeze a trigger is awesome It seems like a small thing but not having to constantly hold down a trigger while vacuuming is amazing ...
389,The capability to easily swap out the battery for a fresh fully charged one is HUGE and it changes your experience when using a handheld On my old Dyson once the battery died I was done for at lea...
390,Having three suction settings are great for when you dont want to fling fine dust and debris all over
391,The Kompressor feature is an interesting way to make up for a small dust bin It also speeds up emptying the full container and minimizes the amount of cleaning necessary when emptying the bin
392,I really like that the entire machine practically can come apart to facilitate cleaning
393,Cons  \nThe dust bin is small The Kompressor feature helps to extend the capacity but its still small compared to my other vacuum
394,The LG feels much heavier than my previous Dyson even though the total weight is not that different The weight distribution is much more top heavy feeling compared to the Dyson
395,The air exhaust blows straight up from the top of the unit Depending on how youre using it it could be blowing straight in your face
396,The extendable floor arm feature is of little value Im concerned at some point it might break and will make the floor attachment useless
397,The design of how the wall mount screws go into the wall makes it impossible to use anything but a manual screwdriver to attach the plate to the wall unless you have a very long narrow screw bit a...
398,The dust bin lid has a small hook on the end that unfortunately catches a lot of dirt and hair when you empty the bin Its also not a touchless design like how the Dyson is designed although the Ko...
399,The WiFi feature is interesting but I dont think it really adds anything necessary It it nice getting notifications of when the vacuum is finished charging and seeing how much time I spent cleanin...
400,Excellent Cleaning System The LG Cordzero is my first cordless stick vacuum and overall I absolutely love it
401,Here’s the things I like about the vacuum  \n The vacuum and accessories are beautiful So much so I almost didn’t even want to use it and get it dirty but alas
402,Setup is really easy with clear instructions and accompanying images
403,The vacuum has a small footprint It easily stores in smaller spaces and corners where you barely notice it but it’s always at the ready
404,Using it is straightforward with three buttons that allow you to turn it onoff toggle between the three power modes normal power and turbo and monitor the vacuum via WiFi and the ThinQ app
405,This thing is versatile with the included extendable wand power nozzle punch nozzle brush tool and crevice tool I have zero issues cleaning hardwood floors carpeting rugs trim furniture and under...
406,It’s also light I can easily wield it onehanded
407,Both batteries charge at the same time with one in the vacuum and the other in the stand
408,Battery life is excellent I am able to clean my partner’s 800 sq ft apartment in power mode with one battery I can clean my 1700 sq ft townhome in power mode with both batteries with juice left o...
409,The entire cyclone system and filters can be removed Filters are washable minimizing replacement costs downtheroad
410,The Kompressor system pushes dirt and dust down inside the dustbin allowing you to clean longer before having to empty it Thought this was a gimmick but it actually works well
411,We have a Beagle running around This vacuum picks up short dog hair with ease I love that I can just grab the vacuum off its stand for quick touch ups seeing as his shedding is constant
412,And the things I don’t like so much  \n While having a vacuum that can give you usage information and help you diagnose problems is nice it’s also a bit unnecessary This is a vacuum cleaner not a ...
413,While the Kompressor system works well most of the time sometimes dog hair gets stuck in the cyclone system When you push the Kompressor down hair sometimes gets above it and requires manual clea...
414,It would be nice to have a way to connect attachments to the vacuum body instead of carrying them with you separately or running back and forth to the vacuum’s stand to swap them out
415,I find normal mode to be a bit weak when it comes to suction I run the vacuum on power mode at all times
416,These minor flaws do not detract significantly from my overall thoughts on this vacuum as no product is going to be perfect for everyone I think this vacuum hits enough marks to be a really great ...
417,Light weighteasy to maneuver Let me start my review by saying that vacuum cords are the bane of my existence I fight with them constantly run them over with the vac pull them out of the wall by ac...

419,It has a cool power punch nozzle for bedding It doesnt spin it beats the bedding which loosens up dog hair and other things in the bed cookie crumbs My dogs hair doesnt even come out with washing...
420,I ran it on a single charge for several days using it off and on I let the bin get very full and still had strong suction I like the Kompressor sic lever that packs the dirt and dust down so you c...
421,The only downside I have found is that it did not work well in my car In its defense my car is REALLY dirty with a lot of small rocks and pebbles
422,I was able to vacuum up cobwebs on my porch a place I could never bring my corded vacuum cleaner
423,Of course it is wifi compatible and has an accompanying app called LG thinQ With the app you can check charging status and length of use Cute addition but not necessary
424,LG Cordless with KOMRESSSOR  Works for me The plusses are that this can charge 2 batteries at once So it is not as heavy as the larger Vacuum cordless competitors\npowerful for the size and picks ...
425,Small Design Details Make Big Impact Cordless stick vacuums have been synonymous to a certain brand we all know very well Since then there has been an influx of stick vacs from various manufacture...
426,Here is what I loved about the LG CordZero
427,\n Removable Battery Packs  This is a killer feature Swap em for more run time when you need it Also most batteries lose steam after a couple of years and those builtin solutions require you to se...
428,Longer Run Times  Each battery averaged about 3035 minutes using the Power Nozzle which I use mostly on normal power LG does advertise 60 minutes per battery but only if youre using the nonpowere...
429,Telescoping Wand  You don’t realize how convenient this is until you’ve tried it yourself Very useful on stairs
430,Very Lightweight  My current stick vac a 2019 model is heaaavvvy The CordZero is very light and it is especially convenient when used in handheld fashion
431,An OnOff Toggle Button  That’s right You don’t have to pull and hold a trigger to keep the vacuum running No hand fatigue
432,Kompressor  With this dirt compactor lever it helps keep the machine small enough yet allows for more dirt bin space Kind of a innovative way to solve the bin space problem and keep the vacuum li...
433,Charging Stand Footprint  With the telescoping wand in the shortened position the vac can be stored most anywhere without sticking out and up like a sore thumb It’s simplistic design also helps k...
434,Here’s what I didn’t like
435,\n Very Lightweight  Wait what Well since it is lightweight I feel like the Power Nozzle is not “digging its claws” into the carpetrug floor if you know what I mean I don’t have any scientific pro...
436,No OnBoard Attachments  You cannot attach any tools onto the stick vac Well at least I think you can’t It’s kind of nice to have the tools you need right when you need them
437,A Trigger Guard  But no trigger I think the grip would feel a lot more comfortable without the trigger guard there No need to have it in my opinion
438,Power Punch tool  I get the principle of its use but I found myself continually smearing pet hair back and forth A handheld power roller would have been a better attachment in my opinion
439,Power Nozzle clearance  I had problems getting the roller head deep underneath small clearances I currently do not have this problem with my incumbent vacuum
440,A 3 bar battery indicator  Im probably being nitpicky but it would be nice to see a time remaining display on the unit
441,But none of this really matters unless the CordZero actually sucks Luckily the suction power of the CordZero is plenty for the needs of most consumers It has three settings Normal Power and Turbo ...
442,Lg vacuum Really easy to install but the manual has various LG vacuum models and accessories which made it difficult to follow The pictures also are small so we not sure which accessories we had u...

466,Hard Floors  debatable on what tools you are using Reg attachment seems to like to push the stuff away then to pick it up
467,Like I said earlier I am spoiled by this Stick Vac and find myself not even touching the other vacs I have had for years
468,Side note this Vac has a TON of protective plastic on it make sure you get it all off
469,Better than a Dyson In the past Ive had the Dyson v8 V10 and V11 and have had issues with every single one of them Finally got this because it is similar to the Dyson v8 and I liked that style Thi...
470,Good but not great I bought this product after extensive research into cordless vacs and the results have been a mixed bag

808,• Sturdy storage stand
809,Lacks storage locations for included power punch head
810,• Lightweight and comfortable
811,• Adjustable wand
812,Cons
813,• Works well on carpeting but struggles on hard floors
814,Powerhead does not adjust for flooring types so it tends to push small debris instead of picking them up This is especially noticeable on hard floors
815,• Clogs easily
816,Small debris become trapped in the dust cup inlet
817,Debris tend to become trapped above Kompressor™ requiring manual removal
818,Runs smooth I love this vacuum very smooth easy to put together Love the battery life on the 2 packs Very nice

821,Pros  \n A charging stand that has storage for the attachments

825,Battery life I have about a 3000 sq ft house with mostly hardwoods so I dont have to use full power much But it will vacuum the entire house thoroughly and still have half power left about 30 min...
826,Sleek high tech look Its a very futuristic looking vacuum The status display that indicates the battery power and other icons is digital
827,It has a slider that makes it easy to clean dirt and dust stuck to the filter in the dust bin No more reaching into the dust bin to pull stuff out
828,Cons  \n While the stand has room for storing attachments you cant fit the smaller brush attachment Might as well design it to fit everything and not just a couple accessories
829,The smaller brush head is ineffective It has a yellow rubber brush that vibrates and doesnt spin I find that it balls up pet hair making it easy to pick up but it doesnt suck it up So I have to t...
830,WiFi feature I didnt get to try it out so I dont really know what it does Its only compatible with 24 Ghz wifi networks My mesh network is set at 5 Ghz and Im not going to switch it to 24 Ghz for...
831,The dust bin requires 2 steps to open and clean You have to push a button to open the lid and then push the slider down to clean it out Minor issue but seems like it would be easy to make the sli...

851,I would definitely recommend this cordless stick vac to anyone looking for a great cleaning solution for their home
852,Great product Does exactly as it should and more Love it Makes me excited about cleaning Its light weight and so convenient
853,High Quality Right out of the box this vacuum just feels of good quality This wasn’t a big surprise to me since it’s considered to be up there with the other highend stick vacuums — and in my opin...
854,In a nutshell this vacuum is worth it’s premium price when you consider the quality build and maybe most importantly the fact that you get two extendedlife batteries to increase your usage times f...
855,What I like what I wish was different
856,\nThe batteries — This is a definite upgrade from previous models that also came with 2 batteries Going from the previous 80 min to 120 min of run time on low is a big plus
857,Larger dust bin — This is another positive upgrade going from a 128 ounce capacity to 384 ounces means less trips to the wastebasket — especially when you couple this with the following design imp...
858,Kompressor technology — This is a rather simple but useful addition to increasing your run time between dumping the bin It’s a springloaded ring that slides down around the interior cylindrical fi...
859,Power settings — There are 3 settings Keeping it simple I’ll call them low medium and high what LG calls ‘turbo’ Obviously the higher the setting the faster the batteries are used up When you firs...
860,ChargingStorage stand — Well built heavy duty and you can mount it to the wall if you so desire hardware included The base is weighted so it stays in place fairly well on its own BUT — strangely n...
861,Universal powered head — What LG calls a ‘nozzle’ Looking at previous stick vac systems offered by LG some packages have included both a powered rolling brush head and a powered head with a foam t...
862,Power punch head — This little head is unique There are no rollers — just a bumpy rubberized surface that vibrates or punches the surface being cleaned This really is perfect for smooth blankets o...
863,Im taking away one star because of my concerns regarding the storage stand All in all this is a very good vacuum and I dare say that it would stand up against anything else out there in the stick ...
864,Good product design poor suction The LG design of this vacuum is really good and the power brush works well when being used The issue lies when using any of the other tools that you would use to s...
865,Vacuum Not great for Pet hair battery not always works I need to remove it and try to turn it on again Not worth 69999
866,Overall great vacuum but extremely overpriced Weve been meaning to replace our vacuum for sometime We opted to go with the LG over the dyson Assembly is extremely easy the charging base is excelle...
867,good technology but not for a vacuum worst vacuum ever and the most expensive constantly clogs and shuts down and trying to clear the clog takes forever
868,missmrsms terrible suction for the pricethe canister is way to small and very difficult to clean the fine dirt outhad it for a week and returned

874,The LG Cord Zero was easy to unpack and assemble including its charging and storage stand WiFi was easy to connect and designed to diagnose problems with the appliance using your smartphone and LG...
875,Overall a great stick vacuum cleaner Pros  \n This vacuum is QUIET
876,The vacuum is effective I tried the vacuum on smaller particles and larger objects and I did not have any issues
877,One vacuum head to cover both hardwood and carpet is super nice
878,The vacuum has a Turbo option which is useful for “hard to vacuum” messes
879,The vacuum includes an extra battery and both can be on the charger at the same time which is convenient if you have a large space and don’t want to wait for it to charge
880,Living in an apartment I really appreciated that both a stand and a wall mount are included
881,It comes with a furniture attachment which is useful
882,Cons  \n The vacuum head for carpethardwood is loud when using on hardwood
883,I didn’t find the wifi features to be useful
884,I accidentally hit the canister release once could have been my own error
885,The stand isn’t tall enough to leave the extender and the pointed nozzle attachment on which is frustrating
886,Pros  and Cons I have both the LG CordZero and the Dyson Animal V11 Both are good and each has their pros and cons But when it comes to picking up debris the Dyson wins hands down I have parrots w...
887,What I like about the LG is its a bit lighter and easier to maneuver Especially on stairs The telescoping wand is nice too Also like the stand so it can go all over the house and stay there
888,Also prefer emptying the Dyson dirt cup Comes apart easier
889,So for now depending on the job Im lucky enough to have both vacuums
890,After 69 months in the market for a new vac I wanted to love this vacuum I hate it and only use it as a hand vac now I needed to replace my Dyson hand vac and really needed a stick vac so I purcha...
891,Nice Multi Use Vacuum Set up and instructions were easy to follow
892,LG even supplies 2 quick access cards with all the assembly and maintenance items needed Well formatted and written
893,You also can download an app called LG ThinQ to your phone This is a smart home app for all things LG It allows you to see the usage of the vacuum charge status run diagnostic and shop at LG store...
894,As quick overview below are my pros and cons
895,Pros  • Good Suction levels\n• Rolls Nice – Head stays down\n• Good battery life when in default mode\n• NO CORD\n• SelfCleaning\n• Light weight\n• Extra battery with onboard charging\n• Hidden to...
896,Cons  • Only 9” wide brush\n• Filter bag cost\n• Mop head unit disappointing\n• Would like larger collection bag or canister People with pets\n• Will push around larger items like cerealpretzels o...
897,Overall I really like this LG CordZero It does the job well for what is designed for The Selfcleaning tower is probably the most impressive feature
898,\nAs mentioned above in Cons the only small tweaks I would prefer is to make the head a little larger to cover more area at a time The small size does have the advantage of getting between items ...
899,\n I would also like to see either larger holding bag in the selfcleaning unit or a canister you could just dump out \nWe have two dogs that shed so the cleaning bag located in the selfcleaning st...
900,\nExperience with cleaning  \nThe stick itself is easy to extend with the push of a button Much easier than other units I have tested\nYou can easily add the accessory pieces to reach into ceiling...
901,\nWhat my wife noticed early on is that this unit will clean the light bathroom rugs without sucking them into the head unit like others do Best vacuum so far at this task
902,\nMy experience with cleaning hardwood floors is that if you have normal dirt it cleaned fine If you had a larger piece of dried food such as broken pretzel or a piece of cereal the head unit woul...
903,\nCarpet cleaning worked well in normal mode
904,\nThe power and function switches are located on the top No need to hold the button down to clean like some other units You can hit the plus button for more suction and minus for less If you hold ...
905,Battery Max run time as indicated on the supplied card  Using nozzle  Turbo Mode – 6 Minutes\nPower Mode – 20 Minutes\nNormal Mode – 40 Minutes
906,Using a tool  Turbo Mode – 7 Minutes\nPower Mode – 30 Minutes\nNormal Mode – 60 Minutes
907,\nThe selfcleaning tower unit has a clean look stores all your tools and does a great job emptying the canister It stands 40” tall and need to plug into the wall outlet It stores all accessories a...
908,Every time you store the vacuum you need to retract the stick and place into the base Automatically the unit will empty the canister This is a little loud but only last about 30 seconds You can pr...
909,\nThe Kompressor slider is nice feature It allows you to compact the dirt in the canister using a simple slider lever allowing more use between having to empty Also allows you to discharge dirt wh...
910,Speaking of tools LG does include a small brush to clean out the canister when doing maintenance
911,Filters appear easy to maintain and do an awesome job filtering out the dust and allergen particles
912,Mop Head feature  \nWe did not find this super useful It does an okay job laying water down on the floor to maybe remove something items the vacuum could not but if has no option to spot treat wit...
913,So final thoughts I would say for a house mostly with carpet or hard floors with standard debris this is a nice unit The selfempty feature is fantastic
914,If you have mostly hardwood with kids that drop cereal or such larger Pea size of large items on the floor that you would like to pick up with the vacuum there might be better choices such as vacu...

939,Extraordinary and Beautiful If i could rate the LG CordZero™ All in One Auto Empty Cordless Stick Vacuum with higher than 5 stars i would do so gladly
940,First lets go over 2 terms that make this vacuum as incredible as it is
941,KOMPRESSOR technology means that the dirt and dust is compressed in the waste receptacle thus meaning you have to dump less while vacuuming
942,INVERTER technology means that the motor which boasts a 10 year warranty by LG operates at less than high speed without sacrificing suction power
943,Impressed yet Stick around it only gets better A lot of products boast rhat they are a complete system leaving out that for their system to be complete ya have to shell out some more cash

984,Great for a Stairs So far so dandy Using for spot vacuuming of messes also for mopping and ‘sweeping’ 3 floors of stairs I let the other robots handle floors

1248,1year general warranty and 10year motor warranty
1249,Negatives
1250,No indicator as to what power level you are on no lights etc – had to go by sound
1251,Had to push extremely hard when using on thicker carpets Found lowering handle angle helped
1252,Also handle seemed quite heavy making vacuum feel unbalanced light on cleaning head I was tired of using after 10 minutes due to the heavy handle Luckily since you do not have to hold button to ru...
1253,While “kompressor” function extends times between emptying I found dustdirt would accumulate above it requiring removal of mesh filter to clear
1254,No lights on cleaning head but there are on the mop head Also due to cleaning head design it was a tad too tall to fit under a couple of shelving units Which was not a problem with other vacuums
1255,While I really liked the mop feature you cannot selectchange speed of cleaning heads and there is a “dry” strip in the middle of the pads Water flow is controlled lowoffhigh by a button on the mop...

1315,Best vacuum Powerful suction and long lasting battery but the only problem that mop doesn’t work as it says Overall happy though
1316,Vacuum mop Overall great vacuum Power isn’t as strong as it’s main competitor but it does what it needs to do The mop is good for maintenance Don’t expect a full out mop So it might not be the bes...

1318,And while every vacuum manufacturer seems to be rushing a cordless stick vacuum to market there are only a few of them that are playing at the top of their gameTineco Dyson Samsung and LG All of t...
1319,NoteMiele makes a wellreceived vacuum in this category that is not so identical in design but I find that its lower center of gravity makes it clunky to maneuver
1320,But this new model from LG has a few solid improvements that for me make it recommendable in a very competitive field
1321,1 It comes with TWO batteries not one They advertise this fact claiming two rechargeable batteries that deliver up to 120 minutes of uninterrupted cleaning And the  represents the caveats of usage...

1326,This vacuum is doing everything it can to stand out in a very competitive field
1327,VERY highly recommended

1329,Overall Happy with LG Cordless lighter than competitor brand and suction is powerful bit of downside is the battery time if you put in on turbo mode  drains quickly
1330,Cleaning made better Love this vaccum dont regret spending so much on this product The only reason i wont put 5 stars is due to the fact that it doesnt pick up larger pieces which is no real issue...
1331,Great vacuum cleaner This is a nice vacuum The battery life is excellent The wet vacuum function works well as well as the dry mode I also love the build quality of the vacuum cleaner The weight i...
1332,Great product but requires a lot of effort As a longtime reviewer of many products for Best Buy I have read tons of owner’s manuals assembled many appliances and figured out how to use new product...
1333,Despite those challenges here are the aspects I have fallen in love with
1334,\n• The charging station is such an asset It can go almost anywhere and even be hidden from view yet still conveniently located You know you places the product on the charging station correctly wh...
1335,• The accessories make any cleanup job a breeze from cleaning the floor to your car to curtains and furniture with the combo tool and the crevice too
1336,• The ability to store the nozzles and the cleaning tools in the charging station and nozzle storage cradle means these items don’t get dirty on the floor of the hall closet or lost under other st...
1337,• Adjusting the extension pipe is great for a taller person and it means there isn’t another longer piece of pipe to add on or keep track of
1338,• Being able to adjust the suction power of the vacuum let’s you pick up bigger messes or go faster to clean I primarily use the turbo mode even though that uses up more battery power
1339,• The power of the vacuum is incredible It even picks up pet hair really well from carpets This is the cleanest I have ever seen my rugs and floor
1340,• Most of my floors are hardwood so being able to use low mode for just a small amount of water being released was great
1341,• I haven’t yet tried cleaning the dust bin or the filters but I like that I can clean the filters with water and it comes with a cleaning brush to clean the cyclonic mesh filter
1342,• The two batteries translate to a long battery run time which is perfect if you want to clean the entire house in one session and not have to recharge it every 510 minutes
1343,• While I have used the Kompressor lever to squish down the pet hairdustlint etc I find that dumping it out of the dust bin is super easy
1344,• No cord means no plugging it in detangling yourself or the vacuum It also means you can take it everywhere inside and outside and not have to worry about finding an electrical outlet
1345,• It is fairly light weight yet solid enough that the nozzle isn’t bouncing all over the floor
1346,• There is a nice hard plastic maintenance guide with the main information you need to run clean and troubleshoot the wetdry vacuummop As a bonus there is a suction cup for easy mounting in a spot...
1347,The aspects that are helpful but require more effort
1348,\n• The display on the handle indicates clogged items filter cleaning alerts connection status WiFi indicator and battery charge Four out of five of these display indicators require more indepth r...
1349,• It was nice to not have to purchase specific detergents to use the mop but I question how effective it is to clean with just warm water
1350,• The ThinkQ application didn’t resonate with me so I didn’t connect it I am sure it would be helpful to see the cleaning history frequency time and mode but it didn’t seem as beneficial to me at ...
1351,• The product has many parts that can be cleaned by hand That does mean a lot of attention to put in over time so the product stays in good working order
1352,The downside
1353,\n• I had a tough time figuring out which side of the mop pads had the lines It was even harder to see once I moistened the mop pads
1354,• The mop pads and water tank should be dried completely before storing them The mop pads took about 2 days to dry completely and the water tank about 1 day
1355,I do recommend this product to people This has been the best vacuum I have ever had However I feel compelled to say I would not recommend this for someone who would not take the time to carefully ...

1360,Expensive but versatile Works well but filter can clog easily and you have to stop and clean
1361,Power quiet and light This is a game changer for all types of messes vacumming without the cord is the best grab and go I still have not recharged the battery and its been in light use everyday fo...
1362,Convenient I should of gotten this a long time ago Lighter than a regular vacuum Makes everything easier for moving around the house

1364,Amazing Good job is excellent vacumm good cleaning good sound
1365,Amazing product but expensive Product does everything it says it will do is read only quiet and the extraswappable battery really helps when turbo mode is needed for more than a few minutes

1373,LG Review Better than our Dyson Lighter and easier to empty Enough of a charge to clean the entire house Very happy with this purchase
1374,Amazing I use it to clean everything Car blinds furniture all the vents in the house even the one I couldnt reach before I can clean easily Obviously cleans the hardwood and carpets beautifully

1401,just ok Im disappointed I thought the suction would be much stronger than what it is Do like the dual battery system Overall is just ok and overpriced
1402,Exactly what I needed First thought while opening this box was “Wow there’s a lot of pieces to this puzzle”
1403,In reality though it only took about 5 minutes to put it all together I lost another 5 minutes by not sliding the pad holder down the charging station tube before putting the charging station on t...
